#!/usr/bin/env bash
# import-ryotunes.sh: fetch the current official Ryotunes package from its own
# GitHub release channel, verify it, and drop the verified (optionally signed)
# bytes into an output directory. It is the single importer both the full repo
# build (release/repo/build-repo.sh) and the narrow scheduled refresh reuse, so
# the download / epoch / checksum rules live in exactly one place.
#
# Ryotunes is released on its own cadence as a prebuilt Arch package on
# ryoku-dev/ryotunes, NOT built in the [ryoku] repo. This importer consumes that
# official artifact instead of rebuilding a divergent app: the package's own
# .PKGINFO (its real depends, including quickshell, and its epoch=1 version)
# carries through untouched, and the [ryoku] repo only re-signs it with the
# release key so pacman's signature chain stays intact.
#
# The published contract (kept in lockstep with internal/ryotunesrelease, the
# in-client updater):
#   - the package asset name is EPOCHLESS: ryotunes-<pkgver>-<pkgrel>-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
#   - the package's own .PKGINFO version carries epoch=1: 1:<pkgver>-<pkgrel>
#   - a sha256 sidecar asset sits beside it: <asset>.sha256 ("HEX␠␠filename")
# The epoch is what lets a current build outrank the retired, divergently
# high-versioned build the [ryoku] repo used to ship (2.5.1-1): under pacman
# ordering 1:x-y beats any epoch-0 version, so an old box moves forward.
#
# usage:
#   import-ryotunes.sh <OUT_DIR>
#       resolve the latest release, download + verify the package (and its
#       sha256), verify its .PKGINFO identity/epoch, place it in <OUT_DIR>, sign
#       it when RYOKU_REPO_KEY is set, and print the package path on the last
#       stdout line. All progress goes to stderr, so `pkg=$(import-ryotunes.sh
#       "$dir")` captures just the path.
#
# env:
#   RYOKU_REPO_KEY            gpg key id; when set, a detached <pkg>.sig is written
#   RYOKU_RYOTUNES_REPO       source repo slug     (default: ryoku-dev/ryotunes)
#   RYOKU_GITHUB_API          GitHub API base      (default: https://api.github.com)
#   RYOKU_GITHUB_DL           GitHub download base (default: https://github.com)
#   GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN   optional; sent as a Bearer token to lift the
#                             unauthenticated API rate limit (asset downloads are
#                             public and never need it)
#   RYOKU_IMPORT_RESOLVE_ONLY when set, print the resolved pacman version
#                             (1:<pkgver>-<pkgrel>) and exit WITHOUT downloading,
#                             so a poll can decide whether a refresh is even
#                             needed before spending a download.
