# walks release/packages/*/PKGBUILD, makepkg-builds each, signs with the ryoku
# release key, then `repo-add -s` to produce the signed db. layout matches the
# public mirror at https://repo.ryoku.dev/<arch>/: an <arch>/ subdir holding
# the *.pkg.tar.zst, their *.sig detached signatures, and ryoku.db /
# ryoku.db.sig (+ ryoku.files). publish workflow rclones that <arch>/ straight
# to R2.
#
# db is rebuilt from the package set every run: <arch>/ wiped, repacked from
# exactly the packages produced now. never `repo-add --new`. so: idempotent,
# and a removed package dir simply falls out of the db.
#
# build deps live on the build host only: Go and Qt build the Ryoku binaries,
# Rust builds the native tools, and asusctl additionally needs clang, llvm, and
# libusb. The compositor plugins need Hyprland, hyprcursor, pango, cairo, and
# pkgconf; gradle builds the vendored limine-entry-tool stack with GraalVM
# nativeCompile.
# makepkg runs --nodeps on purpose: runtime depends (and AUR depends) aren't
# needed to compile the artifacts and aren't resolvable here anyway.
