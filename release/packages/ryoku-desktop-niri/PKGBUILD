# Maintainer: Ryoku <releases@ryoku.dev>
#
# ryoku-desktop-niri: the niri compositor variant of the Ryoku desktop.
# Carries niri, the xwayland-satellite X11 bridge, the GNOME portal backend niri's
# caps report, the niri config tree, and the ryoku-wm-niri provider binary
# (ryoku/wm/niri). It provides the ryoku-desktop-compositor virtual, so an
# installed ryoku-desktop is satisfied by it, and may be installed beside
# ryoku-desktop-hyprland: a switch is then a config change, not a package swap.
#
# There is no plugin subsystem here: niri has no plugins, and its caps say so.
#
# built from in-repo sources, no tarball fetch. makepkg runs from a full
# checkout, so the repo root is three levels up.

  # sight until the fix in that build.

  # generated settings.kdl/rebinds.kdl are written by `ryoku-wm-niri apply`, not
  # packaged (see caps.GeneratedFiles). No scripts/ or share picker: niri's leaf
  # keybinds are compositor actions or `spawn ryoku-shell`, and the share picker
