# Maintainer: Ryoku <releases@ryoku.dev>
#
# Ryoku Rashin backend (Go). The optional local agent OS daemon: it maintains a
# markdown knowledge vault, serves the embedded web dashboard on 127.0.0.1, and
# bridges the Hermes agent over ACP. Ships with the desktop but stays inert until
# the user enables it (optional means not running, not absent).
#
# Built from the in-repo source at ryoku/rashin/backend; no tarball is fetched.
# go build reads the committed vendor/ tree (-mod=vendor), so the signed-repo CI
# builds with no network regardless of whatever GOFLAGS makepkg picked up.

# Hermes itself is per-user opt-in (installed by the one-click setup, never
# packaged), but its prerequisites ARE shipped so the install never has to
# bootstrap a toolchain over the network and never dies with a cryptic
# "uv lock missing": uv is the Python project/venv manager the Hermes installer
# and runtime use; gcc backs uv's occasional native dependency builds (the
# installer's own build-tools helper is apt-only, useless on Arch); nodejs backs
# its npm/npx tooling. ryoku-desktop depends on ryoku-rashin, so `pacman -Syu`
# delivers these to existing boxes too. kitty and xdg-open ship with the desktop.
# prowl-agent is the code index rashin's `index` and `wire` drive (the vault
# code map and each agent's Prowl skill); depending on it makes `pacman -Syu`
# and the doctor's rashin reconciler keep it present on every rashin box.
