# fixture test for ryoku-cmd-game-mode (the one-click competitive toggle). stubs
# hyprctl, pkexec, powerprofilesctl and both privileged helpers, points state +
# sysfs scan at a tmp dir, so the real compositor, the real wifi radio and the
# real power profile are never touched. verifies:
#   - toggle lifecycle
#   - compositor goes through `hyprctl eval` (not the keyword path the Lua
#     parser rejects), with tearing + the immediate rule, reverts via reload
#   - the power profile flips to performance and the PRIOR one comes back, not a
#     guessed default
#   - the privileged system tune is applied on start and restored on stop
#   - wifi power-save delegated to the privileged ryoku-wifi-powersave via
#     pkexec (off on start, on on stop)
#   - refuses on battery, before touching anything
#   - clean no-op when there's no wifi device or a helper is missing
#
# helpers are addressed through their env seams (RYOKU_*_BIN) rather than by
# removing a stub from PATH. a bare PATH removal cannot express "absent": on a
# deployed machine `command -v` still finds the real helper in /usr/bin, so the
# absent-helper case silently tested nothing and failed for weeks.
