# Regression test for ryoku-cmd-brightness: the DDC/CI branch must not walk
# every i2c bus when no external monitor is connected. `ddcutil detect` is the
# freeze (#176): on a hybrid laptop it touches 28 i2c buses for over 11s, and
# i2c traffic on the display controller is what locks the whole session on a
# brightness keypress. Gate it on a connected non-panel DRM connector (a sysfs
# read), the same protection 755ed028 added to the sidebar but not to this key
# handler. RYOKU_DRM_PATH lets the connector set be faked.
#
# It must also cache the detected buses per connected-external set, so a docked
# user's repeated presses do not re-walk i2c every time, while a plug/unplug
# (a changed set) refreshes the walk.
