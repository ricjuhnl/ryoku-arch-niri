# Nothing here touches a real daemon, a real socket, or root. Every seam points
# at a tmp fixture -- RYOKU_DOCKER_BIN, RYOKU_DOCKER_SYSTEMCTL and
# RYOKU_DOCKER_SOCKET for the helper, RYOKU_DOCKER_HELPER
# for the script -- and a fake pkexec on PATH acts as an escalation sentinel.
#
# The load-bearing assertions are the NEGATIVE ones: the helper must refuse a
# bad port or an unknown verb BEFORE it escalates, because its polkit grant is
# passwordless. A helper that validated after escalating would be a root hole.
