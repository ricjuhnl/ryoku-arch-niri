# Fixture test for ryoku-monitor's display persistence across a reboot and a
# power-cycled TV (issue #152). A layout saved from the Displays page must come
# back at the next login even when the external display is absent, reports a
# different serial, or returns on a different connector -- the reported case is
# an LG TV over HDMI that reverts on every reboot. Also guards the two matching
# hazards: an EDID-less display must key on its connector (never the bare "||"),
# and booting the same disk on another machine must not drape one panel's
# settings over a different panel on the same port. Runs in fixture mode
# (RYOKU_MONITOR_JSON), so no live compositor is needed.
