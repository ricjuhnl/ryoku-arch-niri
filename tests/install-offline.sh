# end-to-end test of the OFFLINE install path (installation/backend/lib/offline.sh
# wired into installation/backend/ryoku-install), under RYOKU_DRYRUN.
#
# Both Ryoku ISOs bake the whole package closure into a file:// [offline] repo so
# a machine with no network installs and boots. Nothing tested that. The install
# path had two ways to fail an offline user, both silent:
#
#   1. "offline" meant different things on each side. The TUI called an ISO offline
#      when the repo DIRECTORY existed; the backend needed a repo DB. A bake that
#      stopped before repo-add satisfied the first and not the second, so the
#      installer promised an offline install and the backend quietly took the
#      online path into a pacstrap with no mirror to reach.
#   2. RYOKU_ONLINE=0 with no usable repo sailed through preflight, because every
#      network step correctly skips itself when offline, and only failed at
#      pacstrap -- after the disk had already been wiped.
#
# So this pins both the happy path and the refusals, and it pins them where they
# matter: a refusal must land BEFORE the partition step, never after.
#
# Dry-run, so no disk is touched. Every network binary is replaced by a tripwire,
# which is what proves the offline path reaches the network zero times.
