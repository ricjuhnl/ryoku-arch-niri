# fixture test for controller and Bluetooth-adapter support: asserts the shipped
# policy, not its opposite. no hardware is touched and no root is needed; every
# check reads the repo's own package sets, PKGBUILDs and modprobe drop-in.
#
# each assertion here stands for a failure that is silent on the build host and
# only shows up as "my controller does not work" on a user's machine:
#
#   - ERTM back on             -> Xbox pads never finish pairing over Bluetooth
#   - autosuspend back on      -> Bluetooth headsets drop seconds after they
#                                 connect, reconnect, and drop again
#   - a driver left in the AUR -> `ryoku update` is pacman and can never install
#                                 it, so a box that missed the one-shot build
#                                 stays broken with no route to a fix
#   - a base entry with no     -> pacman cannot resolve it and the install breaks
#     [ryoku] recipe
#   - meson dropped            -> both meson packages fail on the build host
#                                 while building fine locally
#   - xone shipped by default  -> blacklists xpad AND mt76x2u, taking wired Xbox
#                                 pads, every XInput off-brand, and MediaTek USB
#                                 WiFi down with it
