# What ships preinstalled

Ryoku is opinionated on purpose. A fresh install is not a bare Arch box you
spend a weekend furnishing; it boots straight into a finished desktop with the
apps, tools, and toolchains already in place. This page is the honest inventory:
every application, CLI, TUI, daemon, and dependency that lands on a machine by
default, and roughly how much disk it all takes.

If you just want the short version: it's about **90 packages** from the Arch
repos, **~20 first-party Ryoku packages** from the `[ryoku]` repo, a handful of
developer toolchains, a small AUR set built after install, and (on the CachyOS
image) the CachyOS performance layer. All told, a fresh box lands at roughly
**13–15 GiB** on disk.

## How the default set is assembled

Nothing here is magic; it comes from four well-defined places, in this order.

1. **`pacstrap`** lays down the base system from `system/packages/base.packages`,
   the developer toolchains from `dev.packages`, and the microcode for your CPU
   from `hardware.packages`. On the CachyOS image it also pacstraps
   `cachyos.packages`. This always happens, online or offline.
2. **The desktop** comes from the signed `[ryoku]` repo: the installer runs
   `pacman -S ryoku-keyring ryoku-desktop`, and the `ryoku-desktop` umbrella
   drags in every first-party component and its hard dependencies.
3. **The AUR set** (`aur.packages`) is built in the post-install step. It needs
   a network, so it's best-effort: the install still completes without it and
   the pieces arrive later.
4. **Hardware conditionals** add only the provider a machine needs. Broadcom
   Wi-Fi gets `broadcom-wl`; a supported ASUS Aura laptop keyboard gets
   `asusctl`. Both packages are available to the offline installer.

The lists live in `system/packages/` and the umbrella is
`release/packages/ryoku-desktop/PKGBUILD`. Those files are the source of truth;
this page is the readable tour.

## The Ryoku desktop itself

These are Ryoku's own packages, built from this monorepo and served from the
`[ryoku]` repo. The `ryoku-desktop` umbrella version-pins them all so a partial
upgrade never leaves the shell QML running against a stale plugin.

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ryoku-shell` | The Quickshell desktop: bar, pill, launcher, overview, wallpaper, visualizer, ryoshot capture, and the lock screen |
| `ryoku-hub` | Ryoku Settings, the control center (Appearance, Animations, Displays, Connections, GPU, Keybinds, and the rest) |
| `ryoku` | The `ryoku` CLI: `update`, `doctor`, `materialize`, rollback, snapshots |
| `ryoku-rashin` | The system-map vault that keeps a live map of where everything lives |
| `ryoku-blobs` | The shared `Ryoku.Blobs` QML plugin |
| `gpk` | GlazePKG, the RyokuArch package manager |
| `ryogami` | The wallpaper daemon the shell drives: static, live, and shader transitions |
| `ryomotion` | The screen-demo recorder and editor |
| `ryostore` | RyoStore: the catalogue of rices, bundles, and bar styles |
| `ryowalls` | The wallpaper browser, preview, and AI enhancer |
| `ryovm` | The virtual-machine manager |
| `ryoku-hypr-plugins`, `hyprglass`, `imgborders`, `hypr-dynamic-cursors` | Hyprland compositor plugins the Hub can toggle |
| `hyprland-preview-share-picker` | The screen-share source chooser the portal calls by name |
| `ryoku-cursors`, `ryoku-cursor-material` | The Bibata cursor set (the default pointer) and the optional Material variant |
| `otf-space-grotesk` | Space Grotesk, the UI sans |
| `ryoku-keyring` | The signing keys for the `[ryoku]` repo |
| `limine-mkinitcpio-hook`, `limine-snapper-sync` | Boot-menu regeneration and the snapshots submenu |

`ryoshot` (the screenshot studio) and the launcher live inside `ryoku-shell`.

## Core system and boot

The bones. Kernel, initramfs, the encrypted-Btrfs boot chain, and snapshots.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `base`, `base-devel` | The core system and build tools |
| `linux`, `linux-firmware`, `linux-headers` | The stock kernel (a reliable fallback), firmware, and headers for DKMS |
| `rust` | Shipped in the base set because several AUR dependencies are Rust programs; every box can always build them |
| `dkms`, `mkinitcpio` | Out-of-tree kernel modules; the initramfs generator |
| `sudo` | Privilege escalation |
| `btrfs-progs`, `cryptsetup`, `dosfstools`, `efibootmgr` | Btrfs tools, LUKS, the FAT ESP, EFI boot entries |
| `limine`, `plymouth` | The bootloader and the boot splash |
| `snapper`, `snap-pac` | Btrfs snapshots, taken automatically around every pacman transaction |

## Networking, Bluetooth, and audio

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `networkmanager`, `iwd`, `wpa_supplicant` | Networking and the two Wi-Fi backends (iwd by default; wpa_supplicant for WPA3 edge cases) |
| `wireless-regdb`, `iw` | The Wi-Fi regulatory database and `iw`; the installer sets the regulatory domain from geolocation or the locale and `ryoku-wifi-regdom` keeps it set, so 5 GHz channels are enabled. `iw` also toggles power-save for Game Mode |
| `bluez`, `bluez-utils` | The Bluetooth stack and `bluetoothctl` |
| `pipewire`, `pipewire-alsa`, `pipewire-pulse`, `pipewire-audio`, `wireplumber` | The PipeWire audio stack, including the Bluetooth A2DP codecs |
| `alsa-utils` | `alsamixer` and friends, so audio stays diagnosable by hand |
| `rtkit` | Realtime scheduling for the audio thread, so it doesn't crackle under load |

## Graphics and the desktop session

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `mesa`, `vulkan-icd-loader` | The GL and Vulkan base (vendor drivers are added per profile) |
| `hyprland`, `xorg-xwayland` | The Wayland compositor and X11 app support |
| `hyprpolkitagent` | The polkit authentication agent |
| `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`, `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` | Screen-share and file-chooser portals |
| `xdg-user-dirs` | The standard home directories |
| `qt6-wayland`, `qt6ct`, `qt6-declarative`, `qt6-5compat`, `qt6-svg`, `qt6-multimedia`, `qt6-multimedia-ffmpeg` | The Qt6 runtime the shell is built on |
| `gst-plugins-base/good/bad/ugly`, `gst-libav` | GStreamer media codecs |
| `adwaita-icon-theme`, `gnome-themes-extra`, `papirus-icon-theme` | The dark GTK theme and the icon themes the shell and apps resolve against |
| `vimix-cursors` | A second cursor theme, on top of the default Bibata set |
| `flatpak` | The portable app channel alongside the Arch and `[ryoku]` repos |

## Login and lock

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `sddm` | The login greeter |
| `polkit`, `gnome-keyring` | Authorization and the secrets store |

## Wayland tools

The small daemons and utilities the desktop leans on every session.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `matugen` | The Material-You palette engine that recolors everything from the wallpaper |
| `brightnessctl` | Backlight control |
| `hypridle` | Idle and lock management |
| `upower`, `power-profiles-daemon` | Battery status and power profiles |
| `fuzzel` | A fallback launcher |
| `grim`, `slurp` | Screenshot capture and region selection |
| `playerctl` | Media playback control over MPRIS |
| `wl-clipboard` | The Wayland clipboard |

## Everyday apps

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `chromium` | The web browser |
| `kitty` | The default terminal |
| `mpv`, `mpv-mpris` | The media player, wired onto the players bus |
| `nautilus`, `nautilus-python` | The file manager and its "Install / Compress / Send with Ryoku" right-click actions |

Every application on this page is yours to remove. Ryoku installs an app once
(on the ISO, or on the first `ryoku update` after a release adds it) and records
that it did; delete it afterwards and no update reinstalls it. (`ryoku doctor`
keeps that ledger in `~/.local/state/ryoku/provisioned`; drop a name from the
file to be offered the app again.) The tools the desktop itself calls, like
`grim` or `matugen`, stay hard dependencies.

## Terminal, CLI, and TUI

The command line Ryoku hands you is already comfortable.

| Package | Kind | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `fish` | Shell | The default account shell |
| `bash`, `zsh` | Shell | Account-wide alternatives selectable in Ryoku Settings |
| `blesh` | Shell | Fish-like highlighting and suggestions for Bash |
| `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, `zsh-history-substring-search` | Shell | Fish-like editing for Zsh |
| `starship` | Prompt | The shared prompt |
| `bash-completion` | CLI | Bash completions |
| `bat` | CLI | `cat` with syntax highlighting |
| `eza` | CLI | A modern `ls` |
| `fd` | CLI | A friendly `find` |
| `fzf` | CLI | Fuzzy finder |
| `ripgrep` | CLI | Fast search |
| `zoxide` | CLI | Smart `cd` |
| `fastfetch` | CLI | The system-info readout |
| `git`, `github-cli` | CLI | Version control and `gh` |
| `jq` | CLI | JSON on the command line |
| `btop` | TUI | The resource monitor |
| `lazygit` | TUI | A git UI |
| `neovim` | TUI | The editor |
| `yazi` | TUI | A file manager |
| `pciutils` | CLI | `lspci`, used to detect your GPU during install |

## Shell runtime helpers

Tools the desktop, the pill, and the capture stack shell out to by name.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `quickshell` | The framework the whole shell UI runs on |
| `cava` | The audio visualizer |
| `cliphist` | Clipboard history |
| `hyprpicker` | The color picker |
| `imagemagick` | Image processing |
| `waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan` | The GPU AI upscaler behind ryoshot's HD export and ryowalls' Enhance |
| `openrgb` | Per-device keyboard and mouse lighting, configurable from Settings > Appearance > Lighting |
| `asusctl` | Native built-in Aura keyboard lighting on supported ASUS laptops; selected by hardware rather than installed everywhere |
| `ddcutil` | External-monitor brightness over DDC/CI (the pill's DISPLAY faders) |
| `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp` | Media transcode and download; also the launcher's live-radio play path |
| `curl`, `libnotify`, `xdg-utils`, `desktop-file-utils`, `python` | The plumbing the stash, scripts, and helpers rely on |

## Screen and capture toolkit

Everything behind the pill's Super+D, Super+U, and voice tools.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `tesseract`, `tesseract-data-eng` | OCR text grab |
| `zbar` | QR-code scanning |
| `gpu-screen-recorder`, `wf-recorder` | Hardware screen recording, with a multi-GPU fallback |
| `hyprsunset` | The night-light color-temperature toggle |
| `wtype` | Types voice-dictation output into the focused app |
| `libqalculate` | The launcher's calculator backend |
| `songrec` | The launcher's Recognize Music |

## Developer toolchains

Every Ryoku machine is dev-ready the moment it boots.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `go` | The Go toolchain |
| `nodejs`, `npm` | Node and npm |
| `python`, `python-pip`, `python-pipx` | Python with pip and pipx |
| `mise` | A runtime version manager |

## Gaming and virtualization

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `gamescope` | A nested micro-compositor that runs a game isolated from the desktop |
| `gamemode` | The performance governor Steam invokes |
| `mangohud` | The FPS and frametime overlay |
| `qemu-desktop`, `edk2-ovmf`, `virglrenderer` | The base VM stack: QEMU, UEFI firmware, and host-GL acceleration |

The heavier passthrough VM pieces (`libvirt`, `looking-glass`, `swtpm`,
`quickemu`, and so on) are installed on demand from Ryoku Settings, not by
default.

## The CachyOS layer (CachyOS image only)

Install from the CachyOS ISO and a Ryoku box *is* a CachyOS box: these are
pacstrapped on top of everything above.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `linux-cachyos`, `linux-cachyos-headers` | The CachyOS-optimized kernel (booted by default) and its headers |
| `cachyos-settings` | The performance tuning (sysctl, udev, modprobe, systemd) |
| `ananicy-cpp`, `cachyos-ananicy-rules` | The auto-nice daemon that keeps the compositor responsive under load |
| `scx-scheds` | The sched-ext userspace schedulers |
| `proton-cachyos-slr` | The CachyOS-tuned Proton build for Steam and Lutris |
| `cachyos-keyring`, `cachyos-mirrorlist`, `cachyos-v3-mirrorlist`, `cachyos-v4-mirrorlist` | Trust and mirrors, so the installed system keeps updating from CachyOS |

## CPU microcode (per profile)

The installer picks these from `hardware.packages` based on your profile. GPU
drivers aren't listed here; separate scripts pick the generation-correct driver
for the card they detect.

| Profile | Package |
|---|---|
| `amd` | `amd-ucode` |
| `intel` | `intel-ucode` |
| `amd-nvidia` | `amd-ucode` + `intel-ucode` (the NVIDIA driver is chosen by a driver script) |
| `vm` | none needed |

## From the AUR (built after install)

These build in the post-install step. They need a network, so they're
best-effort: a fresh box comes up fine without them and they arrive on the next
pass.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `yay-bin` | The AUR helper, bootstrapped first so the rest can build |
| `voxtype-bin` | The offline Whisper voice-dictation daemon (pill Super+`) |
| `localsend-bin` | AirDrop-style LAN file sharing, spoken by the file stash |
| `nvibrant-bin` | NVIDIA digital vibrance for the pill's saturation fader |
| `game-devices-udev` | udev rules and battery reporting for DualSense and Switch Pro pads |
| `xpadneo-dkms` | The Xbox One/Series wireless controller driver |
| `phinger-cursors`, `catppuccin-cursors-mocha`, `apple_cursor` | Extra cursor themes the Hub cursor picker offers |
| `ttf-fraunces-variable` | Fraunces, the editorial serif in the brand type stack |

## Fonts

`inter-font`, `otf-space-grotesk`, `noto-fonts`, `noto-fonts-cjk`,
`noto-fonts-emoji`, `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd`, `ttf-firacode-nerd`,
`ttf-hack-nerd`, and `ttf-material-symbols-variable`. Between them they cover the
Ryoku UI text, Japanese labels and the 力 mark, emoji, terminal glyphs, and the
Material Symbols the bar and pill icons are drawn from. `ttf-fraunces-variable`
comes from the AUR set above.

## Storage footprint

The installer measures this so it can size the root partition, and the numbers
live in `installation/backend/lib/disk.sh` and `filesystem.sh`.

| Figure | Value |
|---|---|
| The `base + dev + desktop` package closure (installed size) | **~13–15 GiB** |
| Bytes physically written during the install | **~13 GiB** (before Btrfs zstd:1 compression, so a bit less on disk) |
| The root-partition floor the installer enforces | **20 GiB** |
| Minimum free space for an alongside (dual-boot) install | `2 + 20 + swap` GiB |
| Minimum target disk for a whole-disk install | **32 GiB** |

So a fresh Ryoku desktop is roughly **13–15 GiB** of real data. The 20 GiB root
floor is deliberately roomier than that: the extra headroom is for the AUR
builds, for Btrfs snapshots, and for the things that download on first launch
(any Flatpaks you add, a voice model, a game). The CachyOS image sits at the upper
end of the range, since it carries a second kernel and the Proton build. The
swapfile is separate and off by default (`RYOKU_SWAP_GIB=0`).

These are the repo's own measured figures. If you want an exact byte count for a
specific profile and variant, resolve the full dependency closure against live
mirrors (`pacman -Sp --print-format '%s'` summed) on the target.
