# Ryoku Rashin

Rashin (羅針, "compass needle") is Ryoku's optional agent OS: a machine-generated
knowledge vault, a local daemon with a web dashboard, and a one-click Hermes
agent setup. It gives any coding agent (Hermes, Claude Code, codex, opencode,
omp/pi) an exact map of the system instead of burning tokens rediscovering it.
Everything is local, off by default, and enabled from Ryoku Settings under
Advanced.

## What it is, and is not

It is:

- **Optional.** The `ryoku-rashin` binary ships with the desktop but stays inert
  until you enable it. Optional means not running, not absent.
- **Local.** The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` only. WebSocket upgrades verify the
  Origin host is localhost. No auth, because the surface is single-user local.
- **Off by default.** Nothing runs, indexes, or wires until you flip the gate.

It is not:

- **An MCP server.** Markdown files are the interface every agent already
  speaks. MCP is a possible v2.
- **Remote.** No listener leaves the loopback interface.
- **A bundled LLM.** Hermes brings its own provider; you pick one during setup.

## The vault

The vault is the knowledge base every agent reads and writes, at
`~/.local/share/ryoku/rashin/` (respects `XDG_DATA_HOME`).

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | The entry contract, read natively by codex, opencode, and omp |
| `CLAUDE.md` | A symlink to `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code |
| `system.md` | Generated: hardware, kernel, drivers, displays |
| `desktop.md` | Generated: the Ryoku map (configs, owners, reload commands) |
| `packages.md` | Generated: package sets, versions, update state |
| `ryoku-repo.md` | Generated: the Ryoku source tree map, pre-indexed and shipped |
| `user.md` | Generated: where this user's config diverges from the shipped baseline |
| `habits.md` | Generated: this user's directories, tool stack, and shell rhythms (feeds both ask lanes) |
| `memory/` | Agent-writable; Hermes `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` live here |
| `journal/` | Agent-writable dated notes, one file per day |

**Fence markers.** Every generated file is fenced between
`<!-- rashin:generated:begin -->` and `<!-- rashin:generated:end -->`. A reindex
rewrites only the content inside the fence; anything a user or agent adds outside
it survives. `AGENTS.md` is written from a template only when absent, then owned
by the user and agents.

**Write rules for agents.**

- Generated files (`system.md`, `desktop.md`, `packages.md`, `ryoku-repo.md`,
  `user.md`) are read-only. Do not edit inside the fence; a reindex overwrites it.
- Read `desktop.md` before searching the filesystem or guessing paths. It names
  where every config lives, which binary owns it, and how to reload it.
- Changes listed in `user.md` are the user's own choices; never revert them to
  shipped defaults without being asked.
- Write durable notes to `memory/` and dated notes to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Reindex triggers: daemon start, `ryoku-rashin index`, a 6h timer, the
dashboard's reindex button, and `ryoku update` (both channels reindex after
configs land, so agents see the new system immediately). The user layer also
reindexes on its own: the daemon fingerprints the live `~/.config` every two
minutes and rewrites `user.md` when it drifts.

## The pre-indexed source map

`ryoku-repo.md` maps the monorepo that produced the system: layout with file
counts, key entry points, and the docs list. The installed target has no
checkout, so the map ships as a snapshot:

- **Packaged:** the `ryoku-rashin` PKGBUILD runs `ryoku-rashin repo-index` over
  the exact release tree and installs the result to
  `/usr/share/ryoku/rashin/ryoku-repo.md`. A system update replaces the
  snapshot with the new release's, and the post-update reindex folds it in.
- **Dev checkout:** `ryoku/shell/deploy.sh` writes the same snapshot to
  `~/.local/state/ryoku/rashin-repo.md` on every deploy.
- **Live regeneration:** with `RYOKU_RASHIN_REPO` pointing at a checkout,
  reindex regenerates the map from the tree instead of copying a snapshot.

## The user-owned changes layer

`user.md` diffs the shipped base config (`/usr/share/ryoku/config`, the tree
`ryoku materialize` lays down) against the live `~/.config` by content hash,
and lists three classes: dedicated user-override files (`hypr/user.lua`,
`kitty/user.conf`, `fish/user.fish`, `hypr/monitors_user.lua`), shipped files
the user edited in place, and shipped files the user removed. Agents treat
everything listed there as the user's own choices, distinct from Ryoku
defaults. On a dev checkout without the base tree, the layer degrades to a
note saying the diff is unavailable.

## The ryoku skill

Rashin ships an agent skill, `ryoku`, so any agent finds the desktop's safety
rules and command catalogue the way it finds a hub- or agent-grown skill, not
only through the vault pointer block. It lives in the repo at
`ryoku/rashin/skills/ryoku/` (`SKILL.md`, `bar.md`, `plugins.md`); the package
installs it to `/usr/share/ryoku/skills/ryoku`, and a dev deploy resolves the
checkout copy through the repo pointer.

`SKILL.md` covers when to use it, the vault-first rule, the safety split (never
edit a shipped file; a user override goes to `~/.config/ryoku/user_edits` or a
command), the command catalogue (`ryoku`, `ryoku-shell`, `ryoku-hub`,
`ryogami`, `ryoku-rashin`), the decision framework, and worked examples.
`bar.md` is the QS Bar and dock guide; `plugins.md` is the plugin contract and
the `ryoku plugin` CLI.

`ryoku-rashin wire` symlinks the skill dir into every agent's skills directory:
`~/.agents/skills/ryoku`, `~/.claude/skills/ryoku`, `~/.codex/skills/ryoku`,
`~/.omp/agent/skills/ryoku`, `~/.hermes/skills/ryoku`, and each
`~/.hermes/profiles/*/skills/ryoku`. `~/.agents` and `~/.hermes` are created;
the rest are wired only when the agent's home already exists. `unwire` removes
only the symlinks that point at the skill dir, and `status --json` reports a
`skillWired` flag per agent. The skill dir resolves in one order:
`RYOKU_RASHIN_SKILLS`, then `/usr/share/ryoku/skills`, then
`<repo>/ryoku/rashin/skills` via `~/.local/state/ryoku/repo`. The doctor's
rashin reconciler re-runs `wire` whenever a link is missing, so an update keeps
the skill in place.

## The daemon: `ryoku-rashin`

One Go program (module `ryoku-rashin`), stdlib plus one dependency
(`github.com/coder/websocket`) for the chat and vitals sockets. It follows
`ryoku-shell` conventions: atomic writes, `RYOKU_*` env overrides, single
instance via a flock. The gate and port live in `~/.config/ryoku/rashin.json`
(respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`):

```json
{ "enabled": false, "port": 3600 }
```

Subcommands:

| Command | Job |
|---|---|
| `serve [--if-enabled]` | HTTP and WebSocket on `127.0.0.1:3600`, embedded dashboard. `--if-enabled` exits 0 immediately when the gate is off (the autostart path) |
| `index` | Regenerate all vault maps: `system.md`, `desktop.md`, `packages.md`, `ryoku-repo.md`, `user.md` |
| `repo-index <root> [out]` | Build the Ryoku source map from a checkout; used by the PKGBUILD and `deploy.sh` |
| `ask <question>` | One-shot quick ask, built for the launcher's `\` prefix: POSTs to `/api/ask` and pipes streamed `@working`/`@perm`/`@answer` markers to stdout. `ask --recent` prints the resume history as JSON; `ask --cancel` stops the running turn. See "Quick asks: two lanes" below |
| `setup` | One-click actuator: install Hermes, run its onboarding, wire, enable |
| `wire [agent]` | Apply vault pointers to all detected agents, or one named agent |
| `unwire [agent]` | Remove vault pointers, keeping the file |
| `status [--json]` | Report daemon, vault, hermes, and wiring state |
| `enable [--at-boot]` / `disable` | Start or stop the daemon and its autostart. With systemd, `enable` runs `systemctl --user enable --now ryoku-rashin` so the dashboard starts at every login and restarts on crash; `--at-boot` adds `loginctl enable-linger` so it starts when the machine boots, before login. Without systemd it falls back to a detached spawn for the session |

The daemon runs as a **systemd user unit** (`ryoku-rashin.service`, shipped to
`/usr/lib/systemd/user` by the package, `~/.config/systemd/user` by
`deploy.sh`). The unit runs `serve --if-enabled`, so the `enabled` gate in
`rashin.json` stays the single source of truth: a disabled rashin exits
immediately even if the unit fires. It no longer rides the Hyprland session,
so it survives compositor restarts and is up before the desktop paints.

The dashboard serves on `http://127.0.0.1:3600`. The HTTP API (all localhost)
covers `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/vitals` (also pushed on `WS /ws/vitals`),
`GET /api/vault` and `GET /api/vault/file?p=`, `POST /api/index`,
`GET /api/agents` with wire and unwire, `GET /api/hermes/skills`,
`GET /api/hermes/memory`, `GET /api/prowl` and `GET /api/prowl/search?q=`,
`GET /api/about`, and `WS /ws/chat` for the Hermes bridge. Vitals come from
`/proc` and `statfs`, with GPU via `nvidia-smi` when present.

## Quick asks: two lanes

A launcher ask does not always need the full agent. `/api/ask` routes it:

1. **Fast lane (fabric-style, with tools).** When hermes's configured provider
   speaks plain chat-completions (openrouter, openai, groq, ollama, or a local
   endpoint), the daemon runs a bounded agent loop on that same model
   connection: a terse pattern prompt plus the vault's generated maps, and a
   small set of READ-ONLY Go-native tools that run in milliseconds:
   `system_query` (packages, updates, service, processes, disk, kernel, gpu,
   network), `read_file`, `list_dir`, `search_code` (prowl), and
   `fetch_url`. Up to four tool rounds, then the answer, usually a second or
   two. The model replies `TOOLS_REQUIRED` only when the ask needs something
   these tools cannot do (generating or editing files or images, an
   interactive browser, running a hermes skill, or changing the system), which
   escalates it.
2. **Session lane.** OAuth backends (openai-codex) and escalated asks go
   through the real hermes session with its full Python toolset, which the
   daemon **pre-warms at boot** so even this lane skips the ~10s cold start.
   The terse-mode preamble keeps answers short.

The fast lane's tools are deliberately a small, safe, Go-native set, not the
full hermes toolset: that is the trade that keeps it fast. Heavy or
system-changing work is exactly what escalates to the session lane.

Both lanes write the conversation into the shared transcript, so "continue in
dashboard" always opens the full exchange. The fast lane's connection can be
overridden in `~/.config/ryoku/rashin.json` for a cheaper or local model:

```json
{ "quick": { "model": "llama3.2", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1" } }
```

`keyEnv` names the `~/.hermes/.env` variable holding the key when the endpoint
needs one; hermes-known providers resolve their key automatically.

### Action chips

The `@answer` payload carries an `actions` array: entities the daemon found in
the answer text and verified against this machine. The launcher renders each as
a chip that does the obvious thing, so an answer is a launch point, not a
dead end:

| Kind | Detected as | Chip does |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | a path that exists and is a file | opens it in `nvim` (a kitty window) |
| `dir` | a path that exists and is a directory | opens it in the file manager |
| `url` | an `http(s)` link | opens it in the browser |
| `cmd` | a backtick span whose first word is on `PATH` | copies the command |
| `color` | a hex color, shown with a live swatch | copies the hex |

Plus a COPY chip for the whole answer and CONTINUE IN DASHBOARD. The answer
text itself is selectable for mouse-copying a fragment. Nonexistent paths and
non-runnable backtick spans are dropped, so a chip never lies.

### Continue while it works, and cancel

While the agent is still working, two options sit under the pulsing strip:
**CONTINUE IN DASHBOARD** opens the dashboard chat, where the same turn is
streaming live (the daemon runs each turn on a background context, so it keeps
going even after the launcher closes), and **CANCEL** stops it. Escape cancels
a working ask; the daemon interrupts both the fast lane and any session-lane
turn.

### `\resume`

Typing `\resume` lists recent quick asks (persisted at
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/ryoku/rashin-asks.jsonl`, newest first). Picking one recalls
its stored answer instantly, chips and all, with no model call. Every completed
ask, from either lane, is recorded there.

## In the terminal

The launcher's `\` ask has a sibling on the command line: the `rashin`
command. `rashin take me to the fastfetch config` answers from the same brain
and drops a ready-to-run command on the fish prompt; `rashin scan Documents
for pngs and move them to Pictures` returns the one-liner (it knows the
directory is `Pictures`, from `habits.md`). It never runs anything itself, the
buffer is the confirmation, and every command carries a danger tier
(read/write/system/danger). It shares the daemon, the vault, and the ask
history with the launcher and dashboard, so `\resume`, `rashin --resume`, and
"continue in dashboard" all see one conversation. Repeated asks become saved
recipes (`rr-<name>` fish abbreviations). Full design and UX in
`docs/rashin-terminal.md`.

## The dashboard

Hand-authored HTML, CSS, and JS embedded in the binary. No node, no build step,
no CDN; fonts and art ship in the repo. It deliberately does not use the desktop
Tokyo Night language: the look is Japanese retro poster and print brutalism, near
black paper with cream ink and a vermillion sun disc.

| Panel | Content |
|---|---|
| Overview | Hero poster header, vitals as poster stat blocks, daemon and hermes state, code intelligence card (prowl doctor counts, files and symbols, hotspots) |
| Vault | File tree, rendered markdown, reindex button, generated-fence badges |
| Memory | Provider tiles (builtin or external, with Obsidian vault detection), a force-directed graph of the vault's notes and their references, a 26-week activity heatmap, and the Hermes session history read from `~/.hermes/state.db` |
| Skills | Every Hermes skill grouped by category with origin counts (bundled, hub, agent-grown), live search, and the enabled toolbelt grouped into families |
| Agents | Detected CLIs, wiring state per agent, wire and unwire actions |
| Chat | The full Hermes conversation surface (below) |
| About | What Rashin is, the pieces with live facts, quick start, a command crib (`hermes -h`, `hermes gateway`, `hermes model`, `hermes tools`, `prowl overview`), and the privacy note |

### Chat

The chat panel talks to Hermes over the daemon's ACP bridge (Agent Client
Protocol over stdio, the interface Zed uses). Beyond streamed text, thoughts,
tool cards, and permission prompts, it carries:

- **Images**: attach (paperclip), paste, or drag-drop up to three; the client
  downscales to 1568px JPEG and sends them as ACP image blocks.
- **Links**: markdown links and bare URLs render clickable (new tab).
- **Command legend**: typing `/` opens a fuzzy-filtered popup of Hermes's slash
  commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/tools`, `/compact`, ...) with keyboard nav.
- **Model picker**: a chip shows the current model; clicking lists every model
  hermes advertises, with a recent-five section, and switches live.
- **Session history**: a drawer lists stored sessions; loading one replays its
  transcript; NEW SESSION starts fresh.
- **Context meter**: a thin bar tracks the session's token usage.
- **Working strip**: while the agent acts, a pulsing dot names what it is
  doing right now, fed live from the hermes stream: the running tool's title
  (`read: system.md`), `thinking` during reasoning, `writing` while the answer
  streams, `waiting for your approval` when a permission is pending. Clears at
  turn end.
- **Approvals**: when hermes wants to run something that needs consent, it
  sends `session/request_permission` over ACP with the tool title and the
  options it will accept. The dashboard renders them as allow/deny stamps;
  the reply goes back over the same request, and cancelling a turn answers
  any pending request as cancelled. Nothing runs while a request is open.

Terminal `hermes` and web chat share the same memory, because both run in the
vault workspace.

## Prowl ships with Rashin

`prowl` is Prowl, the code-intelligence indexer and MCP server Rashin's
agent brain uses to read this system's source: it builds a `.prowl` index over a
tree and answers structural questions (where a symbol is defined, who calls it, a
change's blast radius) in one call instead of grepping. The CLI was renamed from
`prowl-agent` to `prowl`; the pacman package is still `prowl-agent` and upstream
still ships the old binary name, so both may be on PATH during the transition. It
is no longer an optional hand-install: `ryoku-rashin` depends on the `prowl-agent`
package, so the desktop set ships it and every rashin box has it.

- **`ryoku update` keeps it current.** A packaged box gets new Prowl builds with
  the rest of the system through `pacman -Syu`; the packaged binary carries a
  managed-build guard, so a hand-run `prowl update` defers to the package
  manager instead of overwriting the pacman-owned file. On a dev box (Prowl
  installed by hand, not owned by pacman) `ryoku update` runs `prowl update`
  for you. Either way the update logs one line saying which path it took.
  If a box enabled rashin before the dependency shipped and lacks the binary,
  `ryoku doctor` reports it with the fix `sudo pacman -S prowl-agent`.
- **The mirror index lives with the vault.** `ryoku-rashin index` builds a
  read-only mirror of the live config at `~/.local/share/ryoku/rashin/source/`
  and indexes it with Prowl (see "The source mirror" below), so `search_code`
  and the prowl MCP server answer on a packaged box with no checkout.
- **Agents get Prowl's skill.** `ryoku-rashin wire` also runs `prowl skills
  --yes --clients <detected>` for the clients Rashin detects (claude, omp,
  and hermes), installing Prowl's own agent skill alongside the `ryoku` skill, so
  an agent gains its code-intelligence guide in the same pass. It is skipped on a
  Prowl too old to apply non-interactively (no `--yes` in `skills --help`).

## Prowl integration

When `prowl` (the code-intelligence indexer) is on PATH and a repo with a
`.prowl/` index is found, the daemon surfaces it read-only: doctor finding
counts, files and symbols, top hotspots on the Overview card, and
`GET /api/prowl/search?q=` for content search. The repo is a dev checkout when
one carries an index, else the vault's config mirror (see "The source mirror"
below), so a packaged box answers too. Prowl is optional and user-installed;
everything degrades to a hidden card without it.

## The source mirror

On a packaged box there is no source checkout for prowl to index, so the
prowl MCP server and `search_code` would otherwise answer only on a
maintainer's machine. Every reindex closes that gap: when prowl is on
PATH, Rashin mirrors the live config (`~/.config/quickshell`, `~/.config/hypr`,
and `~/.config/ryoku/*.json`) into `~/.local/share/ryoku/rashin/source/` (with
rsync when available, else a Go copy that skips symlinks and files over 2 MB),
writes a short `README.md` marking it read-only, and runs `prowl init
--integrations agents,agent-skills,claude,omp` and `overview` there under a
120 s budget, so the mirror carries Prowl's index plus its AGENTS.md block, MCP
config, and skills. It is a read-only copy for the index alone; edits there are
overwritten and never reach the desktop.

`prowlRepo()` prefers a dev checkout that carries a `.prowl` index (the
deploy-recorded checkout, honouring `RYOKU_RASHIN_REPO` and
`~/.local/state/ryoku/repo`), and falls back to the mirror when it carries one,
so the code index answers everywhere while a dev checkout still wins on a
maintainer's machine. The whole step is best effort and bounded: a missing
prowl or a copy error degrades it and never fails the reindex.

## One-click setup

The `setup` verb runs in a floating kitty (the Extras pattern), streaming
progress as JSON to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ryoku-rashin/setup.json`, which the Hub
page watches live. The flow:

1. **Preflight:** check `curl`, a Python toolchain (`uv` or `python3`), network
   reachability, and disk space; detect an existing Hermes. `uv` and `nodejs`
   ship as `ryoku-rashin` dependencies, so the check passes on a stock box and
   the installer never bootstraps a toolchain over the network (nor dies with a
   cryptic "uv lock missing" on a half-finished, offline install).
2. **Install Hermes** via its official installer under `$HOME` (skipped if
   present). Setup never runs with sudo.
3. **Onboard:** run `hermes setup` interactively in that terminal so you pick a
   provider and model right there (skipped if already configured).
4. **Wire:** ensure the vault, reindex, point Hermes's workspace at the vault so
   `MEMORY.md` and sessions live there, and write the vault `AGENTS.md` pointers.
5. **Global pointers:** append a marker-fenced block to each detected agent's
   global instructions file (see below).
6. **Enable** the daemon (at boot via lingering when the desktop allows it,
   else at login) and open the dashboard.

### Two Hermes safety rules

Hermes is the resident agent, and setup treats an existing install as sacred.

1. **Never clobber an existing Hermes.** If Hermes is already installed and
   configured, setup skips install and onboarding entirely and only wires. Your
   provider and model choices are untouched. Wiring uses the supported interface,
   never a raw edit of `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.
2. **Wiring is re-checked on serve start; drift shows in status.** Hermes's own
   onboarding can rewrite its config, so wiring runs after `hermes setup`
   finishes, and `ryoku-rashin serve` re-checks the wiring on start and re-applies
   it if it was lost. `status` reports drift so the Hub and dashboard can offer a
   re-wire action.

## Agent pointers

Wiring appends one marker-fenced block to each detected agent's global
instructions, telling it the vault exists and to read it first. The block is
idempotent (wire replaces an existing block or appends a fresh one) and reversible
(unwire removes the block and leaves the file):

```markdown
<!-- ryoku-rashin:begin -->
## Ryoku Rashin system vault

This machine runs Ryoku (Arch Linux, Hyprland desktop). A maintained map of the
system lives at `~/.local/share/ryoku/rashin/`. Before exploring the machine or
guessing paths, read `AGENTS.md` there: it says where every config lives, which
binary owns it, and how to reload it. Write durable notes to `memory/` and
dated notes to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
<!-- ryoku-rashin:end -->
```

Wire targets, one per detected agent:

| Agent | File |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` |
| Oh My Pi | `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| Hermes | `~/.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md` |

Blocks are additive and only touch agents that are already present; Rashin never
creates an agent's own directory (except opencode's `~/.config/opencode`).

## Testing from a terminal

The vault is plain markdown, so any agent that reads `AGENTS.md` sees the same
map. To confirm the wiring end to end:

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/ryoku/rashin
hermes
```

Ask it something about the machine ("what GPU is in here and how do I switch
graphics modes?"). A wired Hermes reads `AGENTS.md`, follows it to `desktop.md`,
and answers from the vault instead of probing. Then write a note:

```sh
echo '- tried the vault, it works' >> journal/$(date +%F).md
```

Reopen the dashboard's Vault panel and the new journal entry is there, because the
terminal and the web chat share one workspace.
