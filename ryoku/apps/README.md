# apps/

The applications Ryoku ships and their settings, one folder per app. Each folder
maps to a place under `~/.config` (except the small helper script noted below).

## What's here

- `kitty/` The terminal. JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, a beam cursor, and fish as the
  shell. `kitty.conf` includes `current-theme.conf`, which carries the Ryoku dark
  palette (background `#171717`, foreground `#CCD0CF`, accent `#F25623`).
- `fastfetch/` The branded system readout. `config.jsonc` draws the 力 logo and a
  short list of facts (host, OS, kernel, WM, CPU, GPU, memory, disk, terminal,
  uptime). `ryoku-fastfetch` is a launcher that uses kitty's graphics protocol in
  kitty and falls back to chafa elsewhere.
- `fish/` The shell. The greeting is turned off so the login terminal stays
  clean, then it runs `ryoku-fastfetch` and wires up starship, zoxide, fzf, and a
  few eza listing aliases (each guarded so a missing tool is harmless).
- `starship/` The prompt: current directory, git branch, and command duration on
  a fixed Ryoku palette.
- `nvim/` The editor (LazyVim seed) plus `ryoku-nvim.desktop`, which registers
  neovim as the default text handler.
- `yazi/` The terminal file manager (`yazi.toml`).
- `npm/` (`npmrc`) and `pip/` (`pip.conf`) keep each package manager writing under
  the home, so neither needs root.
- `nautilus/` The graphical file manager. Ships one `nautilus-python` extension,
  the Ryoku stash actions on the right-click menu (install, compress, LocalSend);
  see its README. No dconf settings to ship.
- `mimeapps.list` The default-application map (text files route to neovim).

## GUI apps

These are full applications, not `~/.config` seeds. Two shapes live here:

- a **Quickshell app** ships its `quickshell/` tree as `qs -c <name>`
  (`ryovm`, `ryostore`);
- a **compiled Qt app** builds from a `CMakeLists.txt` to `/usr/bin/<name>`.
  The packaging supports it; nothing uses it today.

The music app lives in [Ryotunes](https://github.com/ryoku-dev/ryotunes), with a
native Quickshell client and libmpv daemon. `release/repo/import-ryotunes.sh`
imports its checksummed release package unchanged and signs it for `[ryoku]`;
the distro does not rebuild a separate music app.

A shell *surface* is a fourth thing and does not live here. `ryoshot` and
`welcome` launch the same single-instance way but ship inside the shell at
`ryoku/shell/quickshell/<name>/`, with no `.desktop` and no launcher entry.

- Wallpaper browsing, grading, sources and the theme surface now live in the
  shell's wallpaper picker (Super+W), not here; ryowalls was sunset.
- `ryovm/` **Ryoport**, the machine hub: one console for local virtual machines,
  remote VPS, and SSH connections. Three plates behind a nav rail (Super+Shift+V,
  still `qs -c ryovm`): a **Dashboard** fleet overview, a **Machines** yard built
  on quickemu/quickget (a Library of your machines and a Catalog of ~700
  downloadable systems, in-app downloads via the `ryovm-fetch` Go helper, per-VM
  cores/memory, snapshots, Window / SPICE / Headless, and live pause/balloon/pin
  through the `ryovm-mon` helper), and a **Remotes** fleet that reads `~/.ssh/config`,
  shows live reachability and agentless health probes, and connects in a tap
  (the `ryossh` Go helper). Engines: `ryovm` (VMs) and `ryossh` (remotes). The
  GPU-passthrough gaming VM is still configured from Ryoku Settings > GPU, not here.
- `ryostore/` The store: discover and install lockscreens, rices, bar styles,
  plugins and bundles. Engine: the `ryostore` Go backend.

## Single-instance launch

Every one of them launches behind a lock:

```
flock -n -o /tmp/<name>.lock qs -c <name>
```

`-n` fails immediately while the lock is held, so a second launch dies instead of
opening a duplicate window. `-o` closes the descriptor before exec, so the lock
follows the app rather than the wrapper.

A keybind needs more than that. Because `flock` exits nonzero on a held lock,
pressing the key while the app already runs on another workspace does nothing
visible: the window stays where it first opened, and the key reads as dead.
`ryoku-summon` is the answer, and every keybind goes through it:

```
ryoku-summon <window-title> <launch command...>
```

It moves a matching window to the active workspace and focuses it, and execs the
launch command only when nothing matches. It matches the live title first and the
initial title second, since an app that retitles itself would otherwise fall
through to the launcher. It ships from `hyprland/scripts/` and lands on `PATH`, so
any app may call it.

## Adding one

`package()` in `release/packages/ryoku-desktop/PKGBUILD` walks `ryoku/apps/*/`,
so dropping a directory in ships it and there is nothing to register. The
directory name is the identity: it becomes the config name, the icon name, and
the binary name.

| Path                | Ships as                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `quickshell/`       | the package stages it under `/usr/share/ryoku/config/quickshell/<name>/` and `ryoku materialize` lays it at `~/.config/quickshell/<name>/`, where it runs as `qs -c <name>` |
| `quickshell/logo.svg` | the launcher icon, installed as `<name>.svg`                |
| `<name>.desktop`    | `/usr/share/applications/`, carrying the `flock` line         |
| `bin/*`             | one `/usr/bin` entry per file                                 |
| `<helper>/go.mod`   | a Go helper, built to the binary its `module` line names      |
| `CMakeLists.txt`    | a compiled Qt app at `/usr/bin/<name>`                        |

The loop only looks at a directory holding `quickshell/` or `CMakeLists.txt`.
Anything else is invisible to it and needs its own install lines.

Two things to know before testing by hand. `~/.config/quickshell` is wholly
Ryoku-owned: `ryoku materialize` converges it against the shipped tree and
deletes whatever the repo does not ship, so an app dropped there by hand
disappears on the next update. And a keybind belongs in
`ryoku/hyprland/modules/binds.lua`, while a window that should float wants a rule
in `window_rules.lua` (see `float-ryostore`).

## Install paths

| Folder          | Destination                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `kitty/`        | `~/.config/kitty/`                        |
| `fastfetch/`    | `~/.config/fastfetch/` (config + wrapper) |
| `fish/`         | `~/.config/fish/config.fish`              |
| `starship/`     | `~/.config/starship.toml`                 |
| `nvim/`         | `~/.config/nvim/`                         |
| `yazi/`         | `~/.config/yazi/`                         |
| `npm/`          | `~/.npmrc`                                 |
| `pip/`          | `~/.config/pip/pip.conf`                  |
| `mimeapps.list` | `~/.config/mimeapps.list`                 |

The `ryoku-fastfetch` wrapper must also land on `PATH` (for example
`~/.local/bin/ryoku-fastfetch`) so fish can call it on terminal start. It draws
the emblem at `~/.config/fastfetch/fastfetch-emblem.png`, laid there beside
`config.jsonc` by `ryoku materialize` (and the package that ships it).
