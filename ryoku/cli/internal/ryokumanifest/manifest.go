// Package ryokumanifest is the control manifest: what a Ryoku release is made
// of, as data. build-repo.sh generates it at publish time and serves it beside
// the channel's release.json, so a box can ask "what should I look like" and
// compare. It is never hand-authored and never hand-edited: the generator is
// the only writer, and the repo files it reads are the source of truth.
//
// The manifest states intent, not versions. First-party packages are pinned to
// the release that built them (one shared RYOKU_PKGVER, as ryoku-desktop's
// depends already do); distribution and AUR packages are named only, because
// the kernel and the AUR are not Ryoku's to move. That is the same two-lane
// rule docs/updates.md states for `ryoku update`.
