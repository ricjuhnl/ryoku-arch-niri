// upgradeRyotunes moves Ryotunes to its latest published GitHub release as part
// of `ryoku update`. Ryotunes is released on its own cadence as a prebuilt Arch
// package (ryoku-dev/ryotunes releases), not through the [ryoku] pacman repo, so
// it updates on its own channel: internal/ryotunesrelease re-reads the release
// fresh, verifies the download by sha256 and by its own pacman metadata (name,
// version, x86_64), installs it with pacman -U, and only ever moves the version
// forward. It runs on every `ryoku update` channel (git checkout and packaged)
// and outside the [ryoku] package set, so a box with no Ryoku changes still
// picks up a new Ryotunes.
//
// Best-effort, like the AUR and Flatpak lanes: a failure is reported and never
// fails the whole update, and an offline or failed check is never rendered as
// "up to date". Not installed -> nothing to do: Upgrade does no network and
// installs nothing, so a Ryotunes the user removed is not resurrected.

// addRyotunesUpdate folds a pending Ryotunes release into the Ryoku-lane report

// same as a Ryoku package bump: `ryoku update` installs it, so it belongs in the
// lane the update button runs, not the distribution lane. Bounded and read-only
// -- Check never installs and does no network when Ryotunes is absent. An error
// or an up-to-date box adds nothing and never clears the rest of the report, so
// an offline poll is never rendered as a spurious update nor as a false
// "current".
