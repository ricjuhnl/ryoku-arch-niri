// Every entry here must actually be honoured in act or apply. Claiming one this
// provider cannot perform is worse than omitting it: the desktop would offer a
// control that does nothing.
//
// The absences are niri's design, not gaps to fill later:
//
// CapWindowGeometry: a window reports its tile size but no on-screen position,
// so the shell cannot draw windows where they are. It does not need to, because
// CapNativeOverview is present and niri's own overview takes that job.
//
// CapSubmap, CapGlobalShortcuts, CapFocusGrab, CapScreenShader, CapPlugins:
// niri implements none of these protocols or subsystems.
//
// CapLiveConfigEval and CapConfigReload: the config is file-only and niri
// watches it, so there is nothing to evaluate and nothing to trigger.
//
// CapCursorSet: the cursor is a config block, so apply sets it and niri picks
// it up. There is no imperative call to re-assert it after a reload.
//
// CapTiledLayout: the layout is scrollable tiling, with no per-workspace choice
// to make.
//
// CapSpecialWorkspace: niri has no scratchpad workspace.
