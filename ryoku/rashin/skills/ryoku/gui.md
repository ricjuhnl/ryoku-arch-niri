# The Ryoku GUI map

Ryoku has a GUI for almost every setting: the Ryoku Hub for system and shell
config, the wallpaper picker for looks, and QS Bar Settings for the bar and the
dock. When a user asks how to change something, name the surface first, then give
the command the page wraps (SKILL.md, "Answer policy: GUI first"). This file is
the lookup from an intent to its surface, its keybind, and the command behind it.

## Opening the Hub

Ryoku Hub is the settings app; it replaces the old reference settings window.
Super+comma opens it. To jump straight to a page, deep-link it by its section
key:

```bash
ryoku-shell hub open              # the Hub, last page
ryoku-shell hub open keybinds     # straight to Keybinds
ryoku-shell hub open gpu          # Graphics & Power
```

The keys are the ones in the table below; they are the same strings the Hub's
rail uses, so `ryoku-shell hub open <key>` and clicking the rail reach the same
page. Escape closes the Hub.

## The Hub pages

Every row is one page in the Hub rail. `hub open <key>` is shorthand for
`ryoku-shell hub open <key>`. Pages marked advanced show only when the Hub's
advanced view is on; gated pages appear only when the active compositor backs
them (see below), never as dead settings.

| Rail name | `hub open` key | Page | What it owns |

## Surfaces outside the Hub

Wallpaper, theme, the bar, the launcher, and the Stash are not Hub pages. Reach
them here:

| Intent | GUI surface | How to open | The command behind it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Change wallpaper or theme | Wallpaper picker | Super+W | `ryogami wallpaper ui` (picker), `ryogami wallpaper set\|next\|random` |
| Bar layout, widgets, dock | QS Bar Settings | `ryoku-shell bar settings [route]` | `ryoku-shell bar ...`, `ryoku-shell dock ...` (see bar.md) |
| Launch an app | App launcher | Super+Space | the shell launcher (the App Launcher page tunes it) |
| Screen time and downloads | Stash | Super+S | a shell surface; no config command |

QS Bar Settings routes are `bars`, `layout`, `widgets`, `dock`, and `community`,
so `ryoku-shell bar settings layout` opens straight to the layout lanes. The bar
also carries a Wallpaper widget that opens the same picker. bar.md covers the bar
and dock model in full.

## Compositor-gated pages

The Hub shows no page for a capability the running compositor lacks. It gates
Displays (`monitorConfig`), Plugins (`plugins`), Window Manager (a backing
provider), and Layer Rules (shown only with rules present); each appears only
when the active compositor supports it. Animations and the performance and gaming
scripts are Hyprland-specific and do nothing under another compositor. Keybinds
is the deliberate exception: it is compositor-specific yet stays a top-level page
rather than sitting in the compositor group. A setting you change for a
compositor applies only after switching to that compositor.

## A worked answer

The user asks: "how do I make the screen lock after ten minutes?" The GUI-first
answer names the page first:

> Open Ryoku Hub with Super+comma and go to Graphics & Power > Idle, or jump
> straight there with `ryoku-shell hub open gpu`, then set the lock timer to ten
> minutes.

When the user asks YOU to set it, drive the idle daemon directly
(`ryoku-power idle set ac.lockSec 600`, then `ryoku-idle apply`), then tell them
it now locks after ten minutes and that Graphics & Power > Idle is where they see
or change it. Same shape for wallpaper: point them at Super+W first; when you set
it yourself, use `ryogami wallpaper set <path>` and tell them the picker is
Super+W.
