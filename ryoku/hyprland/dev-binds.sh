# add (on) or drop (off) the Ryoku shell keybinds on the live session so the
# real bindings can be exercised from a dev checkout. The compositor's Lua
# runtime owns binds (plain `hyprctl keyword` is rejected there), and binding
# a bound chord stacks a second handler, so every change is an explicit
# unbind then bind through `hyprctl eval`. `off` re-registers nothing: reload
# the config to restore the shipped bindings.
