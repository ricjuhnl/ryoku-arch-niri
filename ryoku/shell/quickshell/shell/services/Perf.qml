// Perf is the shell's one performance-policy singleton and the single reader of
// ~/.config/ryoku/performance.json (the file Ryoku Settings' Performance page
// writes). It folds four inputs into the effective switches every surface obeys:
//
//   1. the explicit user toggles in performance.json (lowPowerMode is the master),
//   2. the active power profile (PowerProfiles), when powerProfileEffects is on,
//   3. the live battery state (Battery), for invisible savings while discharging,
//   4. Game Mode (Flags.gameMode), which outranks all of them.
//
// Consumers read the derived booleans (blurDisabled, shadowsDisabled, reduceMotion,
// visualizerFrozen, pillFrozen) instead of re-deriving `lowPower || flag`: the
// "lowPowerMode implies ..." and "Power Saver implies ..." rules live here once.
// Motion reads reduceMotion/motionSpeed from here too, so the whole shell shares
// one file watcher rather than a copy per module.
//
// Tiers: only Power Saver forces eye-candy off (it behaves like lowPowerMode).
// Balanced and Performance leave the explicit toggles untouched, so the default
// profile never overrides a user's choice and the desktop stays smooth. Battery
// thrift (slower background polling, and not waking a suspended dGPU) is graceful
// and applies whenever discharging, independent of the profile, because it costs
// the user nothing they can see.
//
// Game Mode is the one tier that ignores the user's explicit toggles, and it is
// meant to: the compositor is already stripped and the CPU is already pinned to
// performance, so leaving the shell's own eye-candy running would spend the
// headroom that was just bought. It is also the only tier where the shell is
// competing with a specific foreground process for the same GPU, which is why it
// goes further than Saver and drops the audio analyser outright rather than
// merely freezing it when idle. Nothing here is persisted: it lasts exactly as
// long as the toggle, and every switch returns to the user's own settings on
// exit.

    // The two audio-driven surfaces freeze when there is nothing to show, which is

    // `freezePillWhenIdle` were folded in as plain always-off switches, so the only
    // choices were "analyse silence forever" (their default) or "never analyse at
    // all". The first is what shipped, and it cost two cava processes plus a
    // permanently damaged surface keeping the compositor awake.
    //
    // "Sounding" is real audio reaching the sink, not just a media player's
    // reported state. Keying idle off MPRIS alone froze the analysers whenever
    // sound had no MPRIS interface -- games, browser tabs, system sounds -- or
    // when the player under-reported between tracks (#61). The ground truth is an
    // active PipeWire playback stream (Audio.streams, itself settled); Media.playing
    // stays as a fast-path so a player that flips to playing before its stream is
    // listed still counts instantly. The hard tiers still win outright below, so
    // Saver, lowPowerMode and Game Mode keep the analysers off even mid-track.

    // above the shells in #60: caelestia and end-4 only animate the bar while a
    // player isPlaying, and a Waybar box has no GPU canvas at all.

    // drifts when silent"), which runs the drift on Balanced and Performance alike.
