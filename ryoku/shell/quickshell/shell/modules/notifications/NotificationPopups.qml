// Notification popup surface (contract 07 sec 1/2.4, sec 8; contract 12 sec 1).
// A per-monitor overlay layer surface anchored to the top edge, on the left or
// right (or centred) per the position setting, reserving nothing (exclusive
// zone 0) and never taking keyboard focus. It holds the flat, newest-first popup
// list (newest at index 0) at a fixed 400 px content width with 14 px between
// cards, floating 16 px off the corner. Each card arrives from off the edge it
// is anchored to (slide + fade + a small scale settle, Motion.notifIn) and, on
// close, is flicked back out the same way (slide + shrink + fade, Motion.notifOut)
// while the cards below hold their slot until it clears, then rise. The surface
// holds its height for a card that is still leaving and unmaps Motion.notifHide
// after the list empties, so the last exit is neither clipped nor cut short; a
// popup arriving in that wait cancels the unmap.
//
// `Notifs.popups` is reassigned as a whole array on every change, which resets a
// plain view (no per-item add/remove animation). A local `cards` ListModel is
// reconciled against it incrementally so the ListView's add/remove/displaced
// transitions actually fire per card.
