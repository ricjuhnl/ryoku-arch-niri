// the derived shadow and blur switches to drop its per-tile drop shadows and the
// frosted-glass blur pass, and reduceMotion to collapse the drag-guide animations
// to an instant cut. The policy itself -- performance.json folded with the
// active power profile and battery state -- lives once in shell.services.Perf, so
// Power Saver (or lowPowerMode) flattens the desktop shadows and glass without a
// second file watcher here.
