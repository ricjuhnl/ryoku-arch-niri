// QS Bar Settings routes, in rail order. One entry per page: its Latin name, its
// kanji seal (a real word, per the desktop's language, never decoration), the
// one-line summary the head prints (kept to a few words: it has one line), the
// words search matches on, and the rail section it sits in.
//
// The panel is about one thing, the bar, so the rail's first group is five
// routes: where the bar sits (Bar), the mark and workspaces that make it this
// user's (Identity), how its widgets are arranged (Layout), what each widget is
// and does (Widgets), and the dock that rides beside it (Dock). A second, parted
// group holds Community: every installed bar plugin that is not Ryoku's own, so
// a widget someone else wrote is never mixed in with the shipped set. What this
// panel used to also carry -- pickers, desktop widgets, the mid-work switches,
// the session -- already has a home (the Hub, or quick settings).
