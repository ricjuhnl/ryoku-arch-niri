"""Ryoku i18n sync: keep the per-language catalogs current from English.

A developer only ever writes English, wrapped at the point it is displayed:
`I18n.tr("...")` in QML, a Hub schema label/desc/group, `i18n.T("...")` in Go,
`t "..."` in the installer's shell. This tool does the rest:

  langs    print the language codes this repo ships (one per line), so CI and
           the shell runtime read the same table this file does.
  extract  scan the tree for every English UI string -> catalog/en.json
  sync     for each target language, translate ONLY the strings it is missing
           (keeping what is already translated and any human overrides), so a
           normal update translates a handful of new strings, never the file.
           --engine google  keyless Google endpoint (default; free, no secret,
                            but context-blind: "Shell" may become a seashell).
           --engine llm     a configured LLM with a domain prompt + glossary,
                            so word senses ("Shell" = the desktop shell) and
                            length are honoured. Needs an API key.
           --force          re-translate every string, not just the missing
                            ones (a one-time pass to upgrade old translations),
                            overrides still win.
           --strict         exit non-zero if any missing string got no
                            translation (so CI surfaces the gap instead of
                            silently shipping English).
  check    report translations that are much longer than their English source
           (the cause of overflowing/overlapping UI). --strict to fail on them.
  cost     price the next full pass: source tokens, output tokens and dollars
           per language for the configured model. --model/--force to compare.
  llm      generate a full language into the layered config dir
           (~/.config/ryoku/i18n/<lang>.json), for a higher-quality pass or a
           language Ryoku doesn't ship. Uses the same prompt + glossary.
  ensure   create ~/.config/ryoku/i18n-llm.json from a template if absent, so
           the user has a key file to fill in.

The LLM is configured either by ~/.config/ryoku/i18n-llm.json or by environment
(RYOKU_I18N_PROVIDER / _KEY / _MODEL / _URL), env winning, so CI can drive it
from a repository secret with no committed key. OpenRouter is the recommended
backend (OpenAI-compatible, one key, cheap models); Anthropic and OpenAI work
too. Placeholders (%1, %2, ...) are shielded so they survive translation, and
overrides/<lang>.json always wins, so a human fix is never overwritten.
