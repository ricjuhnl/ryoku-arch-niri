# Changelog: installation/

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **A second disk shows its partitions and its free space.** The alongside probe
  returned before reporting anything when the target disk was not GPT or had no
  EFI System Partition, and the free-region math read `firstlba`/`lastlba`, which
  `sfdisk --json` emits only for GPT. A prepared data disk therefore looked empty
  in the installer and "Erase whole disk" was the only committable strategy. Every
  readable disk now reports its sector size and free regions before the verdict
  gate, MBR free space is computed from the device size, and a non-GPT disk says
  its space is listed but needs GPT (`backend/lib/disk.sh`, `tui/system.go`).

### Added
- **Install into the free space on a disk that has no ESP.** A GPT disk with free
  space but no EFI System Partition of its own (a second, OS-less drive) now gets
  the `create-esp` verdict: the installer offers "Install in the free space",
  creates a dedicated 2 GiB ESP plus root inside the free region, and leaves every
  existing partition byte-identical. Non-destructive, so it needs no ERASE
  acknowledgement, and the review screen states exactly what will be created
  (`backend/lib/disk.sh`, `backend/lib/preflight.sh`, `backend/lib/bootloader.sh`,
  `tui/main.go`).

### Changed
- **ISOs are named for their release and variant.** A release build produces
  `ryoku-<date>-r<run>-<sha>-x86_64-v0.57.0-beta.19.iso` and, for CachyOS,
  the same name ending `-cachyos.iso`; a build off `main` keeps `-main`. The
  manifest reads the ref and variant back from the name, and the live ISO's
  motd and payload stamp carry the line's name ("Ryoku Onogoro 0.57.0-beta.19
  installer") (`build-iso-reusable.yml`, `bin/ryoku-iso-manifest`,
  `iso/build.sh`, `iso/airootfs/etc/motd`).
- `tests/container-install.sh`: **installs a prebuilt signed repo when
  `RYOKU_PREBUILT_REPO=1`** (the publish's artifact, verified with the release
  keyring at `SigLevel=Required`, no build toolchain) and asserts the release
  and channel the publish named; a hand build still builds with a throwaway
  key. Also asserts the boot guard ships and disarms on a proven boot.
- `iso/build.sh`: **A release ISO bakes from its frozen release directory.**
  `RYOKU_ISO_REPO_URL` (the `repo_url` input of the ISO workflows, which
  `publish-repo.yml` passes for a tagged release) now reaches
  `offline-repo.sh` too, so the live media's `[ryoku]` and the offline closure
  agree on which release the ISO installs; without it both fall back to the
  stable pointer as before.
- `tests/container-install.sh`: asserts the `/etc/ryoku-release` marker, that
  `ryoku version` prints it, and that `ryoku track` refuses to move a box whose
  `[ryoku]` points at a mirror Ryoku does not publish.
- **The locale picker leads with the keyboard's own country.** `be` is both the
  Belgian keyboard layout and the Belarusian language code, and `be_BY.UTF-8`
  sorts and fuzzy-matches ahead of `fr_BE`/`nl_BE` for "be", so a Belgian could
  pick Belarusian (a Cyrillic locale) by mistake and land in a Russian-looking
  shell. The locale step now floats the chosen keyboard's country locales to the
  top and makes one the default highlight, so the intended pick is the obvious
  one (`tui/main.go`, `tui/system.go`).

A ground-up hardening of the installer for real hardware. Granular backend and
ISO detail live in `backend/CHANGELOG.md` and `iso/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Added
- **The publish gate lints the materialized QML for load failures.**
  `tests/container-install.sh` runs `bin/ryoku-dev-lint-qml` over the shell and
  Hub trees against the installed Qt modules after `ryoku materialize`, so a
  file that cannot instantiate (a handler on a signal the type lacks) fails the
  publish instead of blanking a page on every user's box.
- **Zen is the default browser on new installs.** The ISO and install script
  now install `zen-browser-bin` (post-install, best-effort, online-only) and set
  it as the default web browser. `ryoku update` never installs Zen or repoints a
  browser, so existing boxes are untouched; the Super+B browser role prefers Zen
  when present and falls back to Chromium otherwise.
- **Dual-boot handles old 96 MiB Windows EFI partitions.** The installer
  automatically uses a dedicated Ryoku ESP when the existing ESP lacks 8 MiB
  free, without moving Windows partitions or changing the required free-space
  footprint.
- **5 GHz Wi-Fi works after install.** The configure stage now pins the Wi-Fi
  regulatory domain (the country) in the target, so the kernel leaves world
  domain `00` and stops hiding most 5 GHz channels; resolved from `RYOKU_REGDOM`,
  geolocation, or the locale. Detail in `backend/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **A gate before the ISO build.** `tests/iso-preflight.sh` runs the root-free
  installer suite in about ten seconds (shell syntax + ShellCheck, package lists,
  the offline-install regressions, the boot-menu fixtures, the dry-run
  contract matrix, the TUI build and unit tests, update delivery) and blocks the
  Build ISO workflow as its own job, so a known-broken installer can no longer
  spend two hours becoming an ISO that reaches users. The backend test jobs also
  carry timeouts now: a hung fixture used to burn GitHub's 6h default, and the
  suite runs on `unstable-dev` pushes, not just `main`.
- The installer TUI (`tui/`, Go / Bubble Tea v2): `main.go` the UI, `system.go`
  the machine glue and the `RYOKU_*` handoff. Safety gates for legacy BIOS,
  Secure Boot, the live boot medium, the wipe acknowledgement, and online-only.
- `backend/` (`ryoku-install` + `lib/`): a readable top-to-bottom bash install
  driven entirely by `RYOKU_*`, with a full `RYOKU_DRYRUN` mode.
- `iso/`: an archiso profile that boots straight into the TUI (cage + foot).
  Reproducible builds (commit-pinned `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, `-buildid=`-stripped Go
  binaries, `SHA256SUMS`, opt-in `RYOKU_ISO_REPRO` archive pinning), a payload
  provenance stamp, and safe-graphics (`nomodeset`) + copy-to-RAM (`copytoram`)
  boot fallbacks on both firmware paths.
- Install verification: `installation/tests/` (`container-install.sh`,
  `install-vm.py`, `iso-stage-check.sh`) plus the root `tests/install-*.sh`
  fixtures; `RYOKU_SKIP_AUR` for unattended and CI installs. `install-vm.py`
  installs with a non-us keymap (`it`) and asserts it lands in `vconsole.conf`,
  the X11 `00-keyboard.conf`, and Hyprland `keyboard.lua`, guarding the
  keyboard-layout fix end-to-end.
- Docs: `installation/README.md` (the map), `backend/lib/README.md` (the
  per-stage reference), `tui/README.md`, and `docs/installation-hardware.md` (the
  real-hardware playbook).
- The `Ryoku.Blobs` QML plugin and `ryoku-hub` ride the install path: prebuilt
  into the payload and installed onto the target with no build toolchain.

### Changed
- `tests/container-install.sh` asserts the default-app map at
  `/usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list` and asserts materialize does NOT create
  `~/.config/mimeapps.list`: that file belongs to the user's own "Set as default"
  picks, and laying Ryoku's map there is what reset them on every update.
- Dual-boot redesign. `alongside` no longer reuses the Windows/OEM ESP (too small
  for our kernel + initramfs + UKIs, and reuse clobbers Windows' loader): it
  creates a dedicated Ryoku ESP (partlabel `ryokuboot`, EF00) + root (partlabel
  `ryoku`) in the largest free region and never touches the Windows ESP. Minimum
  free space is `20 + swap + ESP` GiB; make room by shrinking Windows first.
- Preflight gates the footguns before the disk is touched: Secure Boot (Limine is
  unsigned; `RYOKU_ALLOW_SECUREBOOT=1` override), a whole-disk (not partition)
  target, and DNS + HTTP reach (installs are online-only).
- Hibernation and Intel VMD are carried into the target: `resume=`/`resume_offset=`
  plus the `resume` hook when a swapfile exists, and `MODULES+=(vmd)` when the
  live kernel needed VMD to see the NVMe.

### Fixed
- **A no-network install now finishes.** Every in-chroot `pacman -S` during the
  offline window resolved against the target's `/etc/pacman.conf`, where core,
  extra, multilib, the CachyOS repos and `[ryoku]` are registered with no synced
  database; pacman rejects the whole transaction over that, so the desktop set
  reported `could not find database` after the base had laid, and the GPU drivers
  and bundled AUR tools failed the same way without saying so. The window now runs
  against a config that registers the baked repo alone. Detail in
  `backend/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **An alongside install stops leaving a broken "Limine" boot entry behind.**
  `limine-mkinitcpio-hook`'s deploy hook fired during pacstrap and registered an
  entry against our XBOOTLDR partition (not an ESP), first in the boot order and
  clashing with an existing Linux's own Limine entries. It is masked for the
  install and `EFI_REGISTER=no` keeps later upgrades from re-adding it.
- The alongside strategy is documented and logged as what it is: install beside
  ANY existing OS, Windows or another Linux, sharing whatever ESP the disk has.
- **A bundled ISO installs with the network down, and the installer now agrees with
  the backend about what "offline" means.** Three things conspired here.
  `netOnline()` answered `true` on a bundled image "because the install can
  proceed", so every connectivity gate silently got "yes" on a machine with no
  network, and whether an offline install worked depended on a short-circuit buried
  in that helper rather than on the gates. The Network step's own card already said
  "no network connection is needed, enter to continue", but its key handler tested
  `netOnline` first, so `enter` did nothing and the user sat at a Wi-Fi picker the
  card never mentioned (the footer advertised the wrong keys, and the step scanned
  the radio it had just said it did not need). Worst of the three: `offlineRepo()`
  called an image offline-capable when the repo DIRECTORY existed, while the
  backend requires a repo DB, so a bake that stopped before `repo-add` satisfied
  the installer and not the backend, and the install quietly took the online path
  into a pacstrap with no mirror to reach. `netOnline()` now reports connectivity
  and nothing else, the gates ask `offlineRepo()` themselves, and `offlineRepo()`
  uses the backend's own db test so both halves answer the same question the same
  way.
- **The TUI fits the screen it is given, so a fresh install no longer hides half
  the installer.** Every frame was built at whatever size the content wanted and
  handed straight to the terminal. `lipgloss.Place` does not truncate: it returns
  oversized content unchanged (`position.go`: `if gap <= 0 { return str }`), so
  the VT wrapped the overflow and sheared the layout: the step rail slid off the
  left edge and the footer carrying the Yes/No buttons dropped off the bottom of
  Review, the one screen that authorises erasing a disk. Measured, the Review
  frame wanted 36 rows and the GPU step 84 columns, while the resize guard waved
  through anything at least 80x20, so the sizes in between rendered broken
  instead of being caught. Frames are now clamped to the grid on both axes, one
  long row can no longer widen a card past its budget (`boxLines` truncates as
  well as pads), and the chrome degrades in priority order (tagline, then the
  block banner, then spacer rows and key hints, then the step rail), so the
  wizard is usable on an 80x24 console instead of refusing to draw. The rail is
  priced in columns, not rows, so a merely short terminal keeps it. The guard now
  fires at 56x16, and says what a live-ISO user can actually do (a smaller console
  font, or `ryoku-install` from the shell) rather than asking them to resize a
  kernel VT they cannot resize (`tui/layout_test.go` pins the frame-fits-grid
  invariant, and that Review keeps the target disk, the strategy and the buttons
  at every size).
- **The disk step reads the disk it was given.** The strategy picker was a
  static list that always led with "Install alongside Windows · keep Windows",
  even on a factory-blank disk: a first-time user on an empty SSD was offered
  a Windows to keep that doesn't exist, and a quick Enter walked them into a
  dead-ended alongside layout. The strategies are now built from the picked
  disk's real layout: a blank disk gets the single honest "Use the whole disk"
  path (nothing exists to erase), a populated non-Windows disk leads with a
  neutral "Install alongside · keep existing partitions", and only a disk that
  actually carries an NTFS install promises to keep Windows. The layout
  screen's footnote and subvolume count also stopped describing a layout the
  backend never creates ("@ / and @nix always included", the real always-set
  is `@`, `@log` and `@pkg`, plus `@swap` when a swapfile is chosen), verified
  against the backend's own `filesystem.sh` (`tui/main.go`, covered by
  `TestDiskStrategiesMatchTheDisk`).
- The packaged install smoke test (`installation/tests/container-install.sh`) now
  installs the full makedepends union of the `[ryoku]` packages, matching
  `publish-repo.yml`. It builds with `makepkg --nodeps`, so every makedepend must
  be present; the Hyprland plugins, wallust (`rust`), and Ryoku.Blobs
  (`qt6-multimedia` + `ffmpeg`) were missing, so the smoke test - and the publish
  gate that reuses it - could not build the `[ryoku]` set.
- The ISO reproducibility check (`installation/tests/iso-stage-check.sh`) diffs
  the twice-staged tree with `--no-dereference`. The baked payload carries
  symlinks (the qylock lockscreen's vendored `QtGraphicalEffects` QML imports,
  archiso wants-units), and following them made `diff` error on the dangling
  targets and fail the build even when the trees were byte-identical.
- **The password step can no longer refuse a good password.** `hashPassword`
  shelled out to `openssl passwd -6`, so the one step of the wizard that has no
  fallback depended on a child process starting and exiting cleanly in a live
  session. Where it did not - a live medium that could not be read, a fork the
  kernel would not grant, an `openssl` that was not what we assumed - the
  password screen answered a perfectly good password with "could not hash the
  password (openssl failed)" and there was no way past it, on both ISOs. The
  installer now computes sha512-crypt itself (`tui/password.go`, written against
  the published specification): no process, no `PATH`, no read of the live
  medium, no parsing of another program's stdout, and the
  `$6$<16-char salt>$<86-char digest>` at 5000 rounds it emits is byte-identical
  in form to what `chpasswd -e` was already being handed. It also closes the
  quieter half of the same bug: `openssl passwd` prints the literal `<NULL>` and
  exits 0 for an empty password, so that string could have become an account's
  hash. `tui/password_test.go` pins the hash to the specification's vectors, to
  the 64/65-byte block boundaries where an off-by-one hides, and to the C
  library's own `crypt(3)` - the code that verifies the hash at every login after
  the install.
- The chosen keyboard layout now reaches every place a password is typed, so a
  non-us layout no longer locks you out after install. The graphical installer
  runs in a Wayland session (cage) whose layout is fixed at launch and `loadkeys`
  only affects the text console, so a password set on (say) an Italian keyboard
  was captured as us and then failed at the login prompt. The keyboard step now
  relaunches the session under the chosen layout (the password is captured in it),
  and the install writes that layout to the console (`vconsole.conf`), the
  X11/greeter (`/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf`), and Hyprland
  (`keyboard.lua`), so installer, SDDM greeter, desktop, and console all agree.
- The TUI's connectivity gate no longer false-negatives on ICMP-filtered
  networks. `netOnline` still treats a default route as online, but its fallback
  fetches an Arch mirror over HTTPS instead of pinging `8.8.8.8` (ICMP is dropped
  by many corporate/hotel/ISP firewalls even where mirrors are reachable), so the
  install is no longer blocked at Review on those networks.
- Partition labels with spaces or other special bytes render and match correctly:
  `lsblk -P` output is decoded through `unescapeLsblk` (the `\xNN` escapes), so a
  dual-boot "Windows Data" partition no longer shows as `Windows\x20Data` and the
  `ryoku`/`ryokuboot` reclaim match is not thrown off by embedded escapes.
- Live-medium exclusion now resolves a layered boot medium to its physical disk.
  `liveDisk` only walked a partition to its parent (`lsblk PKNAME`), so a Ventoy
  boot (the ISO is mapped through a device-mapper node, not a plain partition)
  left the USB unresolved and therefore visible in the disk picker: the installer
  could offer to erase the very stick it booted from. It now walks the inverse
  `lsblk -s` tree to the bottom disk (new `bottomDisk`, covered by
  `TestBottomDisk`); the direct-flash `PKNAME` path is unchanged.
- Disk strategy is fail-closed: a missing or empty selection never defaults to a
  wipe, and a whole-disk install onto a populated disk requires the typed `ERASE`
  acknowledgement (`RYOKU_WIPE_CONFIRMED=1`); a blank disk installs without it.
- `alongside` is idempotent across retries and no longer auto-deletes: partitions
  labeled exactly `ryoku`/`ryokuboot` (leftovers of a prior failed run) abort the
  install unless `RYOKU_RECLAIM_LEFTOVERS=1` (the TUI's typed `ERASE` ack) deletes
  only the unmounted ones before measuring free space; a mounted match is left
  alone, and free-space measurement no longer truncates.
- A dead-CMOS clock is auto-corrected from the mirror's HTTP `Date` header so TLS
  and pacman signatures stop failing; the keyring wait no longer races pacstrap;
  Broadcom Wi-Fi machines get `broadcom-wl`.
- The Limine menu no longer loops on the adopted UKI-tree layout, and a failed
  install leaves `/mnt` mounted with a named stage for inspection.
- TUI: the swapfile is carved from root (raising swap shrinks usable root), and
  the done screen actually runs `systemctl reboot` / `poweroff` on Enter.

### Hardened (adversarial re-audit)

A second, adversarial pass closed the findings a fresh review surfaced on the
pass-1 installer. Per-area detail is in `backend/CHANGELOG.md` and
`iso/CHANGELOG.md`.

- Reproducible builds now survive a non-root local build: `mkarchiso` runs under
  `sudo --preserve-env=SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so sudoers `env_reset` cannot strip the
  anchor, and `profiledef.sh` renders the ISO label and version with `date -u`,
  so one commit builds one name in any timezone.
- `build.sh` fails loudly if a `[core]`/`[extra]` mirror-sync window baked a
  `broadcom-wl` module against a kernel the image does not ship (it asserts one
  kernel module dir carrying `wl.ko`), which had silently killed live Wi-Fi on
  Broadcom laptops.
- The Windows dual-boot playbook gained recovery paths: booting Windows straight
  from the firmware menu when the Limine chainload boot-loops, the ESP fallback
  plus a one-line `efibootmgr` re-registration after a Windows feature update
  reshuffles NVRAM, the BitLocker recovery-key prompt that chainloading triggers,
  and the caveat that Microsoft does not support two ESPs on one disk.
- CI covers the previously unwired suites: the Limine menu and Windows-entry
  fixtures, the disk-teardown and DNS gates, and the installer TUI Go tests join
  the per-area workflow, and the ISO staging reproducibility check runs inside
  the ISO build (skipping cleanly when a runner lacks the Qt6 toolchain).
- Documentation was corrected against the tree: the honest `tests/install-*.sh`
  enumeration and the full airootfs entry list in `installation/README.md`, the
  installer test list in `docs/development.md`, and the twelve `release/packages`
  dirs plus the `ryoku-desktop` dependency set in `docs/structure.md`.
