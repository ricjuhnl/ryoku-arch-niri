# installation/backend/

`ryoku-install` is the script that actually installs Ryoku. The TUI collects the
answers, exports them as `RYOKU_*` environment variables, and runs this backend.
There is no archinstall and no JSON config: just plain bash doing the steps in
order, so you can read the whole thing top to bottom and follow exactly what
happens to the disk.

## Running it

```
RYOKU_DISK=/dev/nvme0n1 RYOKU_DISK_STRATEGY=whole \
RYOKU_HOSTNAME=ryoku RYOKU_USERNAME=ryo \
RYOKU_PASSWORD_HASH="$(openssl passwd -6)" \
RYOKU_KEYMAP=us RYOKU_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8 RYOKU_TIMEZONE=Europe/Madrid \
RYOKU_PROFILE=amd-nvidia \
./ryoku-install
```

It must run as root, on a UEFI machine with Secure Boot disabled, against a whole
disk of at least 32 GiB, with a working network connection (the install is
online-only). Set `RYOKU_ALLOW_SECUREBOOT=1` only if you have enrolled your own
keys -- Limine ships unsigned and will not boot under enforced Secure Boot.

## Dry run

Set `RYOKU_DRYRUN=1` and nothing is written. Every destructive or system command
is printed with a `DRYRUN:` prefix instead of being run, and file writes show the
content they would produce. Preflight reports its checks and returns rather than
probing real hardware, so the full flow can be exercised on any machine without a
target disk. Secrets (the LUKS passphrase, the password hash) are never printed,
even in dry-run.
An `alongside` dry run must set `RYOKU_ESP_MODE=shared` or `dedicated`, because
preflight intentionally does not mount the real ESP to resolve `auto`.

```
RYOKU_DRYRUN=1 RYOKU_DISK=/dev/vda RYOKU_DISK_STRATEGY=whole RYOKU_HOSTNAME=ryoku RYOKU_USERNAME=ryo \
RYOKU_PASSWORD_HASH=x RYOKU_KEYMAP=us RYOKU_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8 \
RYOKU_TIMEZONE=UTC RYOKU_PROFILE=vm RYOKU_REPO=/path/to/repo ./ryoku-install
```

## The RYOKU_* contract

Required:

| Variable              | Meaning                                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RYOKU_DISK`          | Target block device, e.g. `/dev/nvme0n1` or `/dev/sda`.    |
| `RYOKU_PASSWORD_HASH` | `openssl passwd -6` hash of the user password (no plaintext). |
| `RYOKU_DISK_STRATEGY` | `whole` (wipe the disk) or `alongside` (dual-boot; keeps existing partitions and chooses shared or dedicated ESP boot automatically). No default: an empty value aborts rather than risk a silent wipe. |
| `RYOKU_COMPOSITOR`        | Window manager to install, e.g. `hyprland`. Selects the `ryoku-desktop-<name>` variant package. |
| `RYOKU_COMPOSITOR_CONFIG_DIR` | The `~/.config` subdir that compositor owns (the TUI derives it from `wm.ConfigDir`, e.g. `hypr`); seeds the keymap and GPU pin. Empty means an unknown compositor and the install aborts. |

With defaults:

| Variable                  | Default            | Meaning                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `RYOKU_HOSTNAME`          | `ryoku`            | Hostname.                                |
| `RYOKU_USERNAME`          | `ryoku`            | Primary user (wheel, login shell fish).  |
| `RYOKU_KEYMAP`            | `us`               | Console keymap (`vconsole.conf`).        |
| `RYOKU_LOCALE`            | `en_US.UTF-8`      | Locale (`locale.gen` + `locale.conf`).   |
| `RYOKU_TIMEZONE`          | `UTC`              | `Region/City`, or `auto` (ipinfo.io).    |
| `RYOKU_PROFILE`           | `vm`               | `amd-nvidia` \| `amd` \| `intel` \| `vm`. |
| `RYOKU_ESP_GIB`           | `1`                | Whole-disk ESP size in GiB (alongside boot is a fixed 2 GiB). |
| `RYOKU_ESP_MODE`          | `auto`              | Alongside boot target: `auto`, `shared`, or `dedicated`. Auto uses dedicated when the existing ESP has less than 8 MiB free. |
| `RYOKU_SWAP_GIB`          | `0`                | Swapfile size in GiB (0 disables it).    |
| `RYOKU_SUBVOL_SNAPSHOTS`  | `1`                | Create `@snapshots` -> `/.snapshots`.    |
| `RYOKU_SUBVOL_HOME`       | `1`                | Create `@home` -> `/home`.               |
| `RYOKU_SUBVOL_BACKUPS`    | `0`                | Create `@backups` -> `/.backups`.        |
| `RYOKU_REPO`              | `/usr/share/ryoku` | Repo payload on the live system.         |
| `RYOKU_ONLINE`            | `1`                | Pacstrap from network mirrors.           |

Encryption (set together):

| Variable                | Meaning                                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `RYOKU_ENCRYPT`         | `1` to encrypt root with LUKS2.                     |
| `RYOKU_LUKS_PASSPHRASE` | The LUKS passphrase (required when encrypting).     |

Other (all optional, env-only):

| Variable                  | Meaning                                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RYOKU_GPU_MODE`          | Hybrid-GPU render mode, **consumed** after driver install: `offload` (iGPU-first default), `sync` (pin the dGPU as primary), `vfio` (pin the iGPU alone, freeing the dGPU for a VM). Applied with `ryoku-gpu mode` to the user's `~/.config/hypr/gpu.lua`. Empty leaves Hyprland's own selection. |
| `RYOKU_REGION_START` / `RYOKU_REGION_END` | For `alongside`: the exact start/end SECTORS of the free region the TUI's probe chose. The backend places the boot + root partitions there and re-validates the range is still free before writing. Omitted -> the backend picks the largest free region itself. |
| `RYOKU_RECLAIM_LEFTOVERS` | `1` lets `alongside` DELETE *unmounted* partitions labeled exactly `ryoku`/`ryokuboot` (leftovers of a prior failed run). Without it, finding such partitions aborts the install (they may be a working Ryoku install). The TUI sets it after the typed `ERASE` ack. |
| `RYOKU_WIPE_CONFIRMED`    | `1` lets `whole` wipe a non-empty disk (the TUI's typed `ERASE` ack). |
| `RYOKU_REBOOT`            | Non-empty reboots after a successful install.                        |
| `RYOKU_SKIP_AUR`          | Skip the optional AUR set (unattended / CI install).                 |
| `RYOKU_ALLOW_SECUREBOOT`  | `1` to install despite firmware Secure Boot being on (Limine is unsigned). |
| `RYOKU_DRYRUN`            | Print destructive commands instead of running them (see Dry run).    |

## Disk strategies

`RYOKU_DISK_STRATEGY` picks how the target is laid out:

- `whole` wipes the disk and writes a fresh GPT: a `RYOKU_ESP_GIB` GiB ESP
  (FAT32, label `BOOT`) plus a Btrfs root taking the rest. A disk that already
  holds partitions needs `RYOKU_WIPE_CONFIRMED=1` (the TUI sets it after the
  typed `ERASE` ack); a blank disk installs without it.
- `alongside` keeps every existing partition. It creates one 2 GiB FAT32 boot
  partition plus the Btrfs root in the chosen free region. With at least 8 MiB
  free on the existing ESP, the boot partition is an XBOOTLDR and a static
  Limine hop is backed up and added under `/EFI/ryoku` on the shared ESP. When
  the existing ESP is too full, the same 2 GiB partition becomes a dedicated
  Ryoku ESP: loader, kernels and menu stay there and the existing ESP is never
  mounted read-write or modified. Windows or another OS is chainloaded by its
  ESP PARTUUID, and its original firmware entry remains unchanged. A recorded
  non-Windows entry is restored by the packaged post-update hook after Limine
  regenerates the menu. `RYOKU_ESP_MODE` may force either path; the TUI uses
  `auto`.
  Partitions labeled exactly `ryoku`/`ryokuboot` that are verified failed-run
  debris (no filesystem, an empty/kernel-less boot FAT, or an `@`-less Btrfs)
  abort the install unless
  `RYOKU_RECLAIM_LEFTOVERS=1` (the TUI's typed `ERASE` ack) is set, which deletes
  the *unmounted* ones so re-runs never stack partitions; a mounted one, a living
  install (even carrying our label), or a partition it cannot inspect is always
  left alone.

  Minimum free region for `alongside` is `2 + 20 + RYOKU_SWAP_GIB` GiB -- a 2 GiB
  boot partition plus a 20 GiB root floor (the base + dev + desktop closure with
  headroom for AUR builds and snapshots). Make room first by carving an existing
  partition (the TUI's carve view shrinks it in place).

## Online and offline installs

The backend installs either way, keyed on `RYOKU_ONLINE`:

- **Offline (the ISO default).** The live ISO bakes the entire package closure
  (base, every hardware profile, dev, the CachyOS layer, the Ryoku desktop, and
  the AUR set) into one `file://` `[offline]` repo
  (`installation/iso/offline-repo.sh`). When a baked repo with a synced db is
  present the TUI sets `RYOKU_ONLINE=0`, and `lib/offline.sh` points pacstrap and
  every in-chroot transaction at that repo, so the install needs no network. The
  base lays first; the desktop, GPU drivers, and AUR toolset each install as
  separate chroot transactions, so one bad package cannot take the base down.
- **Online.** With no baked repo (or `RYOKU_ONLINE=1`), the base, desktop, and
  dev toolchains download from the Arch mirrors and the signed `[ryoku]` repo.
  The installer probes DNS and HTTP reach *before* the disk is touched and fails
  early with plain guidance if it cannot reach them (a dead-CMOS clock that
  breaks TLS is auto-corrected from the mirror's own clock).

An offline install trusts the baked packages (vetted over TLS at ISO-build time,
`SigLevel = Never` for the local repo) and re-verifies against real keyrings on
the target's first online update. The baked set is a snapshot, so run `ryoku
update` after first boot to pull current packages.

## Progress protocol

The backend streams its log to stdout. To drive the staged rows in the TUI it
also prints sentinel lines:

```
@@RYOKU_STEP <id>
```

at the start of each stage, with `<id>` in order: `partition`, `filesystems`,
`mount`, `pacstrap`, `configure`, `bootloader`. On success it prints
`@@RYOKU_DONE` and exits 0. On any failure it exits non-zero without printing
`@@RYOKU_DONE`.

## Layout

`ryoku-install` is the entrypoint; it sets defaults, validates the required
variables, prints the sentinels, and calls the stage functions in order. The
stages live in `lib/`, split by concern (see `lib/README.md`). The `configure`
stage runs two: the chroot config (`chroot.sh`) then the desktop install
(`deploy.sh`: add the `[ryoku]` repo, `pacman -S` the Ryoku packages, then
`ryoku materialize`), both under the one `configure` sentinel. After the
bootloader and AUR steps, `ryoku_bootloader_finalize` promotes the Limine menu
to the tool-managed UKI tree when its hook is installed. Shared-ESP alongside
mode maintains its two-stage menu; whole-disk and dedicated-ESP mode use the
normal ESP-root menu. `snapshots.sh` then wires Btrfs snapshots.

## What it consumes from the repo

At `$RYOKU_REPO` the backend reads:

- `system/packages/base.packages` for the pacstrap set, plus the matching
  section of `system/packages/hardware.packages` for microcode and GPU drivers.
- `system/boot/limine/limine.conf` (branding) and `default.conf` (cmdline
  template with the `@@CMDLINE@@` token), `system/boot/mkinitcpio/ryoku.conf`
  (HOOKS drop-in), and `system/boot/plymouth/ryoku/` (the splash theme). Each
  has a built-in fallback so a dry run works even before those files exist.
- During the `configure` stage (after the chroot config, no separate sentinel) it
  installs the Ryoku desktop from the signed `[ryoku]` pacman repository: it adds
  `[ryoku]` to the target `pacman.conf`, copies the live mirrorlist in, imports the
  release key from `release/packages/ryoku-keyring` (`pacman-key --populate ryoku`),
  `pacman -S`es the desktop set (`ryoku-keyring ryoku-desktop` -- the ryoku-desktop
  umbrella version-pins and pulls every monorepo component), then runs `ryoku
  materialize` as the user to lay
  `~/.config` from `/usr/share/ryoku/config`. A few unpackaged bits are still
  seeded from the payload: the brand assets, the wallpaper collection,
  `ryoku/apps/npm/npmrc`, the neovim `.desktop`/mimeapps editor defaults, and the
  qylock bundle plus `ryoku/lockscreen/{sddm/setup,install-qylock}` (run in the
  chroot); the home is then chowned. Online-gated and best-effort; `RYOKU_DRYRUN`
  is passed through and missing sources are skipped.

The backend enables `sddm`, `NetworkManager`, `bluetooth`, and `rtkit-daemon`.
When `RYOKU_GPU_MODE` is set it applies the pick once here via `ryoku-gpu mode`
(writing the user's `hypr/gpu.lua`); first-login autostart otherwise runs
`ryoku-gpu persist` and `ryoku-monitor`, so those are not run here.
