# Carry the live session's network setup into the installed system so wifi
# survives first boot. three parts, all required:
#
#   1) pin NetworkManager's wifi backend to iwd in the target. base set ships
#      iwd (not wpa_supplicant), and the live ISO already runs NM over iwd
#      (installation/iso/airootfs/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-backend.conf).
#      that drop-in lives only on the ISO. without an equivalent in the target,
#      NM falls back to wpa_supplicant, finds nothing, wifi can't associate.
#
#   2) copy the saved connection profiles NM wrote while the user joined a
#      network during install (/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
#      *.nmconnection) into the target, preserving the 600 root:root perms NM
#      requires. otherwise the credentials evaporate on reboot.
#
#   3) pin the Wi-Fi regulatory domain (the country) in the target. On world
#      domain 00 the kernel disables or no-IRs most 5 GHz channels, so a dual-band
#      SSID is only ever seen on 2.4 GHz -- the "can only connect to 2.4 GHz" bug.
#      It lives here rather than with the other chroot config because it drives
#      ryoku-wifi-regdom, which reaches the target with the desktop set that
#      ryoku_deploy installs one call earlier. Best-effort: an ISO whose baked
#      desktop set predates the helper skips this, and `ryoku doctor` pins it.
#
# ryoku_network runs in the "configure" stage; ryoku_ensure_dns runs at
# preflight, before the disk is touched. everything routes through the dry-run
# wrappers.
