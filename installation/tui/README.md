# installation/tui/

`ryoku-tui` is the Ryoku installer front-end: a full-screen terminal app that
collects the install choices and hands them to the `ryoku-install` backend. It is
a Go program built on **Bubble Tea v2** (`charm.land/bubbletea/v2`), with
`lipgloss/v2` for styling, `harmonica` for the spring animations, `qrterminal`
for the on-screen QR codes, and `sahilm/fuzzy` for the picker filters. There is
no Go toolchain on the ISO; `iso/build.sh` ships the binary prebuilt.

## The three files

- **`main.go` is pure UI.** Screens, layout, the wizard state machine, the
  palette and glyphs, and all the layout math. It never shells out.
- **`system.go` is the only file that touches the machine.** The live lists for
  the pickers (keymaps, locales, time zones, disks, Wi-Fi), hardware detection,
  the small live actions (apply a keymap, join Wi-Fi), and the streamed handoff
  to the backend. Every `exec.Command` lives here.
- **`password.go` hashes the password**, in-process: sha512-crypt (`$6$`) written
  against its specification, so the one step of the wizard that cannot fall back
  needs no tool, no `PATH` and no readable live medium. It used to run
  `openssl passwd -6`, and a live session where that child process could not run
  left a user stuck at the password screen with a perfectly good password.
  `password_test.go` pins it to the published vectors and to the C library's own
  `crypt(3)`, which is what verifies the hash at every later login.

`system.go`'s `installEnv` builds the `RYOKU_*` environment the backend reads;
that contract is documented in `../backend/README.md`.

## The step flow

The wizard (`steps()` in `main.go`) walks these steps in order:

`keyboard -> locale -> timezone -> network -> hardware -> profile -> gpu ->
diskpick (target disk) -> disk (strategy) -> partitions (layout) -> hostname ->
username -> password -> encryption -> review`

Some steps are conditional: the `gpu` (graphics mode) step matters only on a
hybrid iGPU + dGPU laptop, and the pickers fall back to a small built-in list
when the live tools return nothing, so the wizard renders anywhere. `review` is
the last safe point; nothing is written until it launches the backend, whose
streamed output drives the install screen and its staged rows.

## Safety gates

The TUI refuses to hand a layout to the backend that the backend would reject or
that would destroy data unintentionally:

- **BIOS is a hard block.** `detectHardware` sets `hwBIOS` when `/sys/firmware/efi`
  is absent; the hardware step then will not advance (the backend is UEFI-only).
  The card shows the "disable CSM / enable UEFI" guidance.
- **Secure Boot blocks Review.** `secureBootEnabled` reads the last byte of the
  `SecureBoot` efivar; when it is on, `reviewBlockReason` blocks the install
  (Limine is unsigned). Mirrors the backend's preflight gate.
- **Live-medium exclusion.** `liveDisk` resolves the disk backing the archiso
  boot medium and `excludeDisk` hides it (plus zram / loop / `sr` / eMMC boot
  areas) from the target-disk picker, so the installer never offers to erase the
  stick it booted from.
- **Wipe acknowledgement.** A `whole` strategy on a disk that already holds
  partitions requires the user to type `ERASE` on Review (`wipeStage`); only then
  does `installEnv` emit `RYOKU_WIPE_CONFIRMED=1`, which the backend's
  `ryoku_partition_whole` demands. A blank disk skips the extra step. The
  strategy picker also lists the non-destructive "alongside" first so a quick
  Enter is never a wipe.
- **Offline-first, online fallback.** An offline ISO bakes the whole package
  closure into a `file://` `[offline]` repo (`offlineRepo()`), so `netOnline()`
  returns true with nothing to set up and `installEnv` emits `RYOKU_ONLINE=0` plus
  `RYOKU_OFFLINE_REPO`: the install needs no network at all. A networked ISO
  (built `RYOKU_OFFLINE_SKIP=1`, no baked repo) gates Review on `netOnline()` and
  emits `RYOKU_ONLINE=1`, so a box with no route cannot reach the install handoff.

## Layout math, and how it mirrors the backend

The constants in `main.go` keep the TUI's free-space gate in lockstep with the
backend, so `Tab` never advances a layout that `ryoku-install` would reject
mid-install:

- `minDiskGiB = 32` -- the target-disk floor; matches preflight's 32 GiB check.
- `minRootGiB = 20` -- the minimum root partition; matches the backend's
  `ryoku_min_root_gib` (`20 + swap`).
- `availRoot()` -- the root size: the free region (alongside) or the disk minus
  kept partitions (whole), less the boot partition. Alongside always reserves
  2 GiB; it is an XBOOTLDR when the existing ESP has at least 8 MiB free and a
  dedicated Ryoku ESP otherwise.
- `swapCeil()` -- caps swap at 64 GiB and always leaves at least `minRootGiB` of
  usable root, so swap can never starve the system partition.
- alongside `partReady` requires `minRootGiB + 2` GiB free, matching the backend.

## Running it off-ISO

Normal launch needs an interactive terminal:

```
cd installation/tui
go run .
```

To eyeball the screens on any machine without a TTY, a live disk, or the ISO,
use the built-in snapshot mode. `main()` dispatches `os.Args[1] == "snapshot"`
to `snapshot()`, which renders a fixed sequence of frames to stdout, each under a
`### <title> ###` header:

```
go run . snapshot
```

It renders the welcome screen (plain and with the social QR), the network step
(connected and offline), hardware (detected and the graceful fallback), the
graphics-mode step, the target-disk and partition steps, the password step (with
the strength meter), the done screen, and the install and failure screens. The
install/failure frames use `stepLog` sample output; a live install streams the
real backend output instead. Because the pickers fall back to built-in lists,
the snapshot renders even where the live tools (`localectl`, `lsblk`, ...) return
nothing.

## Tests

Pure-function unit tests, no machine or ISO required:

```
cd installation/tui
go test ./...
```

`partition_test.go` covers the layout math and the safety gates (root carves
swap, the alongside free-space floor, the wipe-confirm plumbing);
`done_test.go` covers the done-screen exit action; `password_test.go` covers the
sha512-crypt hash the whole install hangs on (the published vectors, the block
boundaries, the shape `chpasswd -e` needs, a fresh salt per call, and agreement
with `crypt(3)` where a Perl is around to reach it).
