# Changelog: system/packages/

## Unreleased

### Added
- `aur.packages`: **fingerprint unlock at the lock and login screens.** The
  qylock lock and the SDDM greeter authenticate through a PAM stack that loads
  `pam_fprintd_grosshack.so` (scans the sensor while the password field is live),
  but the module was never packaged, so touch-to-unlock silently did nothing
  even though fprintd enroll/verify in Ryoku Settings worked. `pam-fprint-grosshack`
  now ships here for new installs; `ryoku doctor`'s fingerprint-module reconciler
  backfills existing boxes with a reader (this set is not revisited by
  `ryoku update`).
- `hardware.packages`: **Intel gets the iHD VA-API video-decode driver.**
  `intel-media-driver` joins the `[intel]` section so the live video wallpaper
  and media players hardware-decode on Gen8+ Intel instead of burning a CPU
  core in software. AMD's VA-API already ships in `mesa` and NVIDIA decodes via
  NVDEC through `nvidia-utils`, so only Intel needed a package. It bakes into
  the offline ISO closure.

- `base.packages`: **Bash and Zsh receive Fish-like editing.** `blesh`, `zsh`,
  `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting` and
  `zsh-history-substring-search` ship with every machine so any account shell
  selected in Ryoku Settings has highlighting, suggestions and history search.

- `base.packages`: **the Spicetify Marketplace store ships by default.**
  `spicetify-marketplace` (the store custom app -- the Marketplace icon in
  Spotify's sidebar for themes and extensions) joins `spotify-launcher` and
  `spicetify-cli`, shipped from `[ryoku]` (`release/packages/spicetify-marketplace`)
  so it is a plain pacman target on install, on `ryoku update`, and in the offline
  closure. `ryoku doctor` (`reconcileSpicetifyMarketplace`) copies it into the
  per-user spicetify CustomApps, enables it and applies it, so the store is set up
  out of the box instead of the fiddly manual install. Inert without Spotify.
- `base.packages`: **weston, to run the SDDM greeter on Wayland.** SDDM's default
  X11 greeter was orphaned when the Hyprland (Wayland) session started -- it
  lingered on a leftover Xorg and kept drawing power -- so the greeter now runs
  on Wayland (`DisplayServer=wayland`, `CompositorCommand=weston --shell=kiosk`)
  and SDDM tears it down cleanly at login. weston is the kiosk compositor that
  hosts the greeter as a Wayland client; without it a Wayland greeter cannot
  start. Official `extra` repo, and a `ryoku-desktop` depend so it also reaches
  existing boxes on `ryoku update`.
- `base.packages` / `aur.packages`: `game-devices-udev` moves from the AUR set to
  the base set, shipped from `[ryoku]`. It is not a driver: the kernel binds
  these pads already, but without its rules userspace cannot open their hidraw
  node, so a pad that works as a gamepad still reports no battery and cannot be
  configured by Steam or an emulator. 27 vendors, which is most of what people
  own once they stray from first-party pads: 8BitDo, PowerA, PDP, Nacon, Hori,
  Mad Catz, Razer, Thrustmaster, Valve. It was previously unreachable by `ryoku
  update`, exactly like `spicetify-cli` before it.
- `base.packages`: **Bluetooth adapter firmware is complete.** Arch split
  `linux-firmware` into per-vendor packages and the default set already pulls
  `-intel`, `-realtek`, `-mediatek`, `-atheros` and `-broadcom`, which covers
  essentially every built-in and USB adapter. The one hole is Broadcom's
  patchram blobs: `linux-firmware-broadcom` installs 118 files and zero `.hcd`,
  and Broadcom's USB parts are not self-initialising, so without the `.hcd`
  matching their USB id the adapter enumerates, logs `BCM: Patch
  brcm/BCM20702A1-....hcd not found`, and never comes up. That reads as dead
  hardware. `broadcom-bt-firmware` adds the 114 missing blobs; verified to share
  no file with `linux-firmware-broadcom`.
- `base.packages`: **wireless Xbox controllers work.** Most controllers already
  needed nothing here, which is why nothing was here: `hid_playstation`,
  `hid_sony` and `hid_nintendo` cover DualSense, DualShock and Switch Pro
  in-kernel, and `xpad` covers wired Xbox pads plus every XInput off-brand
  (Turtle Beach among them, claimed by vendor + interface signature since 6.4,
  so there is no per-brand driver to add). The gap was Bluetooth, which `xpad`
  does not speak at all: `xpadneo-dkms` fills it, and it now ships from
  `[ryoku]`.
- `base.packages`: ship `docker` and `firefox`. Docker is what the stash "Cobalt
  engine" switch has always needed and never had: cobalt is distributed only as a
  container image, so on a clean install that switch could not work at all and
  said so with a dead end ("Install Docker to use cobalt"). Both are official
  repo packages, so `base.packages` is simply where they belong; they reach the
  ISO through the offline closure (`installation/iso/offline-repo.sh`) like every
  other repo package. The service is deliberately NOT enabled here: a machine
  that never opens the switch should not pay for a running dockerd, a `docker0`
  bridge and its iptables rules, so the setup wizard enables it on first use. No
  `docker-compose`: the cobalt lifecycle is a single `docker run`.
  Firefox is additive, so a Gecko engine is always on hand for a site Chromium
  renders badly; it does not become the default, because `ryoku-app`'s `browser`
  role stays `chromium` and Ryoku Settings owns the override.
- `base.packages`: `spicetify-cli` moves out of `aur.packages` and ships from
  `[ryoku]` (`release/packages/spicetify-cli`), listed next to `spotify-launcher`
  because neither is useful for the Canvas backdrop without the other. The ISO
  already baked the AUR set and the build gate fails on a missing name, so an ISO
  install did get it; what it could not reach was an existing machine, because
  `ryoku update` is pacman and pacman never touches the AUR. A box that installed
  before this package set, or whose one-shot AUR build failed, had no spicetify
  and no route to one but a manual `yay -S`. As a signed `[ryoku]` package it is a
  plain pacman target: it lands on install, on update, and in the offline closure.

  `pnpm` joins the publish-repo build toolchain for it, and that is not
  decoration: `pnpm build:wrapper` generates `jsHelper/spicetifyWrapper.js`, the
  `Spicetify` global every extension is written against, and it is absent from the
  release tarball. A build that skipped it would look complete and silently break
  the Ryoku Canvas extension.
- `base.packages`: ship the Limine boot stack `limine-mkinitcpio-hook` (bundles
  `limine-entry-tool`) and `limine-snapper-sync` from `[ryoku]`, moved out of
  `aur.packages`. As AUR packages they were skipped on offline installs, so a
  fully offline box booted a frozen flat menu: no other-OS detection
  (`FIND_BOOTLOADERS`), no UKI tree, no boot-menu snapshots. Now they pacstrap
  with the base set, so `bootloader.sh`'s tool-managed path runs on every
  install. See `release/packages/limine-mkinitcpio-hook`.
- `base.packages` + `ryoku-desktop` hard depends: add the Bazzite-style gaming
  stack `gamescope`, `gamemode`, `mangohud`. gamescope runs a game in a nested
  micro-compositor isolated from the desktop, sidestepping the XWayland
  compositing that is the real source of in-game and Steam-overlay lag on Wayland
  (`gamescope -- %command%`); gamemode is the perf governor Steam invokes via
  `gamemoderun %command%`; mangohud is the FPS/frametime overlay. Hard depends so
  the ISO and `ryoku update` both carry them; lib32 variants ride opt-in multilib.
- `base.packages`: add `pciutils`. `lspci` is the GPU-detection path the driver
  scripts use during pacstrap; without it NVIDIA cards were silently missed.
- `base.packages`: add `alsa-utils` (`alsamixer`, `amixer`, `alsactl`) so a muted
  hardware codec can be inspected and unstuck by hand; omarchy ships them in its
  base set too.
- `base.packages`: add `spotify-launcher` so Spotify ships by default. It installs
  per-user (into `~/.local`, never root-owned `/opt`), so the music widget's
  Spotify Canvas backdrop wires up with no root chmod; the client itself downloads
  on first launch.
- `aur.packages`: add `game-devices-udev` (PS4/PS5/DualSense/DualShock and Switch
  Pro udev rules + battery) and `xpadneo-dkms` (Xbox One/Series Bluetooth pads).
- `base.packages`: add `linux-headers` and `dkms` (also hard `depends` of
  `ryoku-desktop`, so `ryoku update` reaches existing boxes). `xpadneo-dkms` (the
  Xbox One/Series Bluetooth driver above) is a DKMS module: without the kernel
  headers and the DKMS build system its module silently fails to build, so an Xbox
  controller was not detected at all until the user installed `linux-headers` +
  `dkms` by hand. `dkms`'s alpm hooks rebuild the module whenever headers land, so
  an existing box self-heals on the next update.
- `aur.packages`: add `spicetify-cli`, the Spotify client patcher the desktop
  music widget's Spotify Canvas backdrop needs. `ryoku doctor` drops the bundled
  `ryoku-canvas.js` extension into the spicetified client and applies it, pointing
  spicetify at the per-user `spotify-launcher` install.
- `base.packages`: add `gnome-themes-extra`, the standalone `Adwaita-dark` GTK
  theme the Hyprland autostart selects (`gsettings gtk-theme`). Without it that
  name has nothing on disk, so GTK3 apps -- notably the `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`
  file chooser (the browser upload dialog) -- fell back to the built-in light
  Adwaita even in the dark session. It is also a hard `depends` of
  `ryoku-desktop`, which reaches existing boxes on `ryoku update` (an optdepend
  never installs on `-Syu`).
- `ryoku-extras-install`: installs and removes `nautilus-pack` guests, skips
  `optional`-tier items in a whole-bundle install (they install one at a time),
  and turns an aborted `interactive` fetch into a *deferred* state. Repo installs
  go through `pacman -Syu` (not `-S`), so a bundle can never trigger a partial
  upgrade (a stale library vs a freshly pulled one), and a bundle's `requires`
  (such as `multilib`) is ensured before its packages route.
- `base.packages`: add `ttf-firacode-nerd` and `ttf-hack-nerd`, two popular rice
  nerd fonts, so the shell's Global font picker has more that render on a fresh
  install (JetBrains Mono already ships). The picker also lists other popular
  families and shows whichever ones you install yourself.
- `base.packages`: add `waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan`, the GPU AI upscaler behind ryoshot
  Beautify's HD ×2 export and ryowalls Enhance, so every fresh install ships it.
  It is also a hard `depends` of `ryoku-desktop`, which reaches existing boxes on
  `ryoku update` (an optdepend never installs on `-Syu`).
- `base.packages`: add `ddcutil`, and `aur.packages`: add `nvibrant-bin`. The
  pill mixer's DISPLAY section drives external-monitor brightness through
  `ddcutil` (DDC/CI) and NVIDIA screen vibrance through `nvibrant`, both
  unguarded and declared nowhere, so on a packaged install those faders were
  silently dead. `ddcutil` ships from `extra`; `nvibrant-bin` is AUR (a no-op on
  non-NVIDIA GPUs). `tests/shell-tool-availability.sh` gained rows for both so
  CI catches the next such gap.
- `aur.packages`: add `mpvpaper`. ryowalls' Live tab plays video wallpapers
  through it (mpv on the background layer), but it was only an optdepend of
  `ryoku-desktop`, so a packaged install never pulled it and live wallpapers never
  worked for users. Listing it in the AUR set the installer installs fixes new
  boxes; `ryoku doctor` points existing ones at `ryoku-pkg-aur-add mpvpaper`.
- `base.packages`: add `wireless-regdb`, so the kernel can load `regulatory.db`.
  Without it the WiFi regulatory domain stays at world `00`, which caps TX power
  (weak uplink, TX rates collapse to the lowest MCS) and disables 6 GHz. The live
  ISO already shipped it, but the installed target set did not, so every install
  booted capped. Kernel-agnostic (shared `/usr/lib/firmware`), so stock `linux`
  and CachyOS kernels are fixed identically.
- `base.packages`: ship the Bluetooth stack, `bluez` + `bluez-utils`. The desktop
  has always had Bluetooth UI (Hub Connections > Bluetooth, the pill's link
  drill-in), but no install ever carried the daemon behind it: org.bluez never
  appeared on the bus, `Quickshell.Bluetooth.defaultAdapter` stayed null, and the
  adapter toggle no-opped silently. bluez-utils ships `bluetoothctl`, which the
  UI's pair-trust-connect flows shell out to. The installer enables
  `bluetooth.service` (see installation/backend).
- `base.packages`: add `nautilus-python`, which runs the Ryoku stash actions
  (Install, Compress, Send with LocalSend) in the Nautilus right-click menu.
- `base.packages`: ship the launcher's three missing tools so its features work
  on a fresh install: `libqalculate` (the calculator's qalc backend for units,
  currency, %, and functions), `mpv-mpris` (exposes the YouTube Music mpv stream
  over MPRIS, so the now-playing card and transport controls work), and `songrec`
  (the Recognize Music action). `tests/shell-tool-availability.sh` now gates all
  three, closing the "feature wired but tool not shipped" gap that let them ship
  broken.
- `base.packages`: add the windowed-VM stack (`qemu-desktop`, `edk2-ovmf`,
  `virglrenderer`) so a VM launches from Ryoku Settings > GPU > Machine out of the
  box. The GPU-passthrough extras (Looking Glass, kvmfr) stay AUR and on demand.
- Cursor themes: ship a curated set of modern XCursor themes the Ryoku Settings
  picker offers, beyond the Bibata family. `base.packages` adds `vimix-cursors`
  (official repo, flat modern); `aur.packages` adds `phinger-cursors` (clean
  rounded, light and dark), `volantes-cursors` (minimal, light and dark),
  `catppuccin-cursors-mocha` (pastel), and `apple_cursor` (macOS style; a source
  build, so best-effort). All install XCursor themes under `/usr/share/icons`, so
  they appear in the picker automatically.
- `base.packages`: add `iw`, used by `ryoku-wifi-powersave` to disable 802.11
  power-save for Game Mode (a low-latency win for competitive play).
- `base.packages`: the curated base set the installer pacstraps.
- `hardware.packages`: per-profile CPU microcode (`[amd]`, `[intel]`). GPU drivers
  come from `system/hardware/drivers/*.sh`, which the installer runs in the target.
- `aur.packages`: AUR add-ons (Limine hooks, Bibata cursors, AUR helper).
- `dev.packages`: the developer toolchains shipped with every machine (Go,
  Node/npm, Rust, Python/pip/pipx, mise).
- `base.packages`: the Ryoku shell runtime (`quickshell`, `awww`, `cliphist`,
  `hyprpicker`, `imagemagick`, `jq`) and the `yazi` file manager. `aur.packages`
  gains `wallust` (palette); `quickshell` moved from AUR to base (now official).
- `aur.packages`: add `localsend-bin` for the AirDrop-style LAN file sharing the
  pill's file stash speaks to. GlazePKG (`gpk`) now ships first-class from the
  `[ryoku]` repo as a `ryoku-desktop` dependency, so it is no longer in the AUR set.
- `base.packages`: add `hypridle` for laptop dim/lock/suspend timeouts and
  `upower` for the shell battery surface.
- `base.packages`: add `openrgb` for wallpaper-driven keyboard and lighting
  color control through `ryoku-leds`.
- `base.packages`: add `noto-fonts-cjk` and `inter-font` so Japanese Ryoku shell
  labels, the 力 brand mark, and the configured UI font render on fresh installs.
- `base.packages`: add `cava` for the pill's separated music visualizer island.
- `base.packages`: add `curl`, `python`, `libnotify`, and `xdg-utils` for the
  pill's file stash (LocalSend LAN discovery and send), weather (wttr.in), and
  opening stashed files with the default app.
- `base.packages`: add `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` for the stash's media compress and
  download actions, and `desktop-file-utils` so installing AppImages and tarballs
  refreshes the launcher's desktop database.
- `base.packages`: add `tesseract` and `tesseract-data-eng` for the pill's Super+D
  toolkit OCR (recognize text in a screen region to the clipboard).
- `base.packages`: add `zbar` for the Super+D toolkit QR scanner (decode a QR code
  in a screen region, copy it, and open URLs).
- `base.packages`: add `hyprsunset` for the Super+U utilities night-light toggle
  (a warm screen color temperature), driven by ryoku-cmd-nightlight.
- `base.packages`: add `gpu-screen-recorder` and `wf-recorder` for the pill's
  Super+U utilities Screen Recorder (gpu-screen-recorder, with a wf-recorder
  fallback on multi-GPU machines).
- `aur.packages`: add `handy-bin`, the offline speech-to-text app behind the
  pill's ``Super+` `` voice dictation. It provides `handy`, a normal desktop entry
  (so Handy shows in app search for configuring models), and pulls in
  `gtk-layer-shell`.
- `base.packages`: add `wtype` so Handy types the transcription into the focused
  app on Wayland.
- `base.packages`: add `snap-pac` for automatic pre/post Btrfs snapshots around
  pacman transactions, wired to the snapper `root` config by the installer.

### Changed
- `aur.packages`: drop `phonto` and `mpvpaper`. The shell's live (video)
  wallpaper backend is now `ryoku-livewall`, which ships in the `ryoku-shell`
  package from the `[ryoku]` repo, so no AUR video daemon is needed. Both old
  backends were client GL pipelines (300-700 MB RSS, mpvpaper also leaked per
  loop) that could not get under the 100 MB target, while livewall
  software-decodes a downscaled clip into `wl_shm` and holds ~40 MB on any GPU
  vendor. `base.packages`: drop `gst-plugin-va`, which was only phonto's VAAPI
  decode plugin; `gst-libav` stays for general GStreamer codec coverage, and
  `awww-git` (the image daemon) is unchanged.
- `aur.packages`: drop `wallust`. It moved to the `[ryoku]` repo as a hard
  `ryoku-desktop` dependency (its AUR package pins a checksum against Codeberg's
  auto-generated source archive, which Codeberg regenerates non-reproducibly, so
  the pin drifts and the build fails), so the AUR set no longer carries it.
- `aur.packages`: drop `awww-git`. The image wallpaper daemon `awww` moved to the
  `[ryoku]` repo as a hard `ryoku-desktop` dependency (`release/packages/awww`), so
  every install and `ryoku update` carries it. As an AUR package it was skipped on
  offline installs and best-effort on a failed build, so a fresh box could come up
  with no wallpaper daemon at all.
- `base.packages`: add `rust`, and `dev.packages`: drop it. The shell's wallpaper
  daemon (`awww`) and other AUR dependencies are Rust programs, so the toolchain
  belongs in the always-installed base set, not the optional dev toolchains; every
  fresh install can build them.

### Fixed
- `hardware.packages`: the `amd-nvidia` profile now pulls `[amd]` + `[intel]`
  microcode. It is offered for an AMD or Intel CPU with an NVIDIA GPU but only
  shipped `amd-ucode`, so an Intel+NVIDIA laptop got the wrong microcode and no
  `intel-ucode`; the mkinitcpio microcode hook keeps only the one matching the
  CPU present, so shipping both is correct on either.
- `base.packages`: ship `papirus-icon-theme`. The shipped Qt icon theme
  (`ryoku/shell/qt6ct/qt6ct.conf`) is `Papirus-Dark`, and `adwaita-icon-theme`
  alone left named freedesktop icons (e.g. `network-wired`, which the Avahi
  desktop entries use) unresolved, since Adwaita carries them only as
  `-symbolic`. With Papirus present the launcher's all-apps grid renders every
  entry's logo instead of a broken-image placeholder.
- `base.packages`: add the desktop session pieces a plain Hyprland needs to render
  and function: `xorg-xwayland`, `hyprpolkit-agent`, `qt6-wayland`, `qt6ct`,
  `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`, and `adwaita-icon-theme`. Without them the installed
  desktop failed (no Xwayland binary, no polkit agent, unthemed Qt/GTK apps).
- `base.packages`: move the wallpaper daemon `awww` to `aur.packages` as
  `awww-git`. It is AUR-only (upstream renamed swww to awww), so listing it in the
  pacstrapped base set aborted the whole install with "target not found: awww".
- `aur.packages`: switch the cursor theme from the source `bibata-cursor-theme` to
  the prebuilt `bibata-cursor-theme-bin`. Both install the whole Bibata family
  (Modern and Original in Ice, Amber, Classic), but the source build needs
  `python-clickgen` and can fail, which left the Ryoku Settings cursor picker with
  only a fallback theme; the `-bin` package never compiles. The stale comment
  (it claimed XCURSOR_THEME=Bibata-Modern-Classic) now matches the real default,
  Bibata-Modern-Ice.
